Coding togetheR is a series of collaborative workshops to teach 
foundational R coding and data science skills at the University of Southampton
in 2019. This book contains the materials covered over eight, two hour sessions.

The workshops are for anyone at the University of Southampton with data to analyse and who is struggling with their current tools. This series of eight weekly two hour workshops provides an introduction to working with data using R in a supported environment. Unlike traditional lessons, we all code together with the emphasis on participants learning by doing and by helping each other.

These materials are a mash-up of my own and many others. I've endeavoured to
credit everyone appropriately, but please message [me](https://ab604.uk/) if I've messed up and I'll correct it.
The main sources used here are: [R for data science (R4DS)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), 
[the R4DS community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/), [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/),
[Hands on Programming in R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/),
[swiRlstats](https://swirlstats.com/) and
[Teaching Tech togetheR](http://teachtogether.tech/en/). 

It was written using R [@R-base] in RStudio 
[@rstudioteam2018] using the bookdown package [@R-bookdown].

To follow these materials you will need an up to date version of R [@R-base] and RStudio 
[@rstudioteam2018]. This may require requesting permission to install software
from Isolutions if you have a University laptop.

## R and RStudio {-}

If you are new to R, then the first thing
to know is that R is a programming language and RStudio is a
program for working with R called an integrated development 
environment (IDE). You can use R without RStudio, but not the other way around. 
Further details in Chapter \@ref(getting-started).

[Download R here](https://cran.r-project.org/) and 
[Download RStudio Desktop here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

These materials were generated using R version 3.6.

Once you've installed R and RStudio, you'll also need
a few R packages. Packages are collections of [functions](#function-anatomy). 

Open RStudio and put the code below into the `Console` 
window and press `Enter` to install the `tidyverse`,`dslabs`,`janitor` and `here` packages.

```{r packages, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse","dslabs","janitor","here"))
```

## Who is coding togetheR for? {-}

Following the lesson design process of [@Wilson2018]:

**Arshad**

 > As a PhD student in ecology Arshad doesn't have any formal coding training,
 but is gathering field data about bird populations. He is daunted by
 the prospect of learning to code. These lessons will introduce Arshad to coding
 by showing him how to organise and automate analysis of his data.
        
**Jenny**
        
> As a post doctoral researcher in gerontology Jenny has experience of research, but
is unsatisfied with her current spreadsheet tools for analysing data. These
lessons will show her how to write code to analyse spreadsheets. 
        
**Lin**

> As a principal investigator Lin has experience using MATLAB, but has
not used R and would like to know more about it. These lessons will introduce 
Lin to R syntax and RStudio workflows.

## Code of conduct {-}

Coding togetheR is for everyone, and in order to make it a supportive and
inclusive environment we subscribe to the [Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html). 
Please follow the link for details.

In a nutshell, expected behaviour is as follows:

+ Use welcoming and inclusive language
+ Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
+ Gracefully accept constructive criticism
+ Focus on what is best for the community
+ Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Participants who violate the code of conduct, will be asked to stop immediately and if
necessary asked to leave the workshop and incidents reported as per [University guidance
on inappropriate behaviour](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/studentservices/need-help/student-discipline/staff-information.page).

<!--chapter:end:index.Rmd-->

# Getting started {#getting-started}

By the end of this chapter are you will:

+ understand how to install packages in RStudio.
+ know how to get help when you are stuck.
+ have set-up your first R project.
+ understand the atoms of R and how to use them to build data frames.
+ understand how to assign objects in R.
+ have created a plot using the `ggplot2` package.
+ have written outputs from R to files.

## Coding is for everyone

If, when faced with the thought of starting to learning to code you feel like the cat in Figure \@ref(fig:imposter).

(ref:imposter) [Imposter syndrome](https://bloggerbyresearch.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/a-baa-fail-cat-among-penguins.jpg).

```{r imposter, fig.cap='(ref:imposter)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/a-baa-fail-cat-among-penguins.jpg")
```

Then hopefully by the end of these materials, you'll feel a bit more like the cat in Figure \@ref(fig:rcat).

(ref:r-cat) [R cat](https://stephensontam.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/lolcat-programmer.jpg)

knitr::include_graphics("img/lolcat-programmer.jpg")
```

## A little background and philosophy

***"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses"***

*Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor C++*

### What is R?

**R** is a programming language that follows the philosophy laid down by it's
predecessor S. The philosophy being that users begin in an interactive
environment where they don't consciously think of themselves as programming. 
It was created in 1993, and documented in [@ihaka1996].

Reasons R has become popular include that it is both open source and cross platform,
and that it has broad functionality, from the analysis of data and creating 
powerful graphical visualisations and web apps.

Like all languages though it has limitations, for example the syntax is initially
confusing.

Users and developers of R have in recent years sought to develop an inclusive 
and welcoming community which can found on twitter `#rstats` or 
through [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/). 
There are many useR groups, including groups seeking to promote diversity such
as [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/about-us/): [Jumping Rivers maintains a list](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/).

### Why learn to code at all?

In terms of the philosophy of learning to code:

1. The primary motivation for using tools such as R is to get more done, in
less time and with less pain.

2. And the overall aim is to *understand and communicate* findings from our
data.

3. Additionally, as per [Greg Wilson's description of his motivation for teaching](http://third-bit.com/2019/01/30/why-i-teach.html), if we're going
to help make the world a better place, a bit of coding is likely to be
key tool in your kit.

(ref:pipeline) Data project workflow.

```{r pipeline, fig.cap='(ref:pipeline)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data_project_pipeline.png")
```

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pipeline) of typical data analysis workflow,
to achieve this aim we need to learn tools that enable us to perform the 
fundamental tasks of tasks of importing, tidying and 
often transforming the data. Transformation means for example, selecting a 
subset of the data to work with, or calculating the mean of a set of observations.

### A little goes a long way

Returning to our cat friend in Figure \@ref(fig:rcat), one doesn't need to be an expert programmer to find coding useful. As illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:prac-prog)
there is a whole spectrum of code users from 
practitioners who are focused on applying some R to their specific problems, to those
programmers who develop the R language itself. In reality one may move
around on that spectrum as ones interests change over time.

(ref:pp) The Practitioner-Programmer spectrum

```{r prac-prog, fig.cap='(ref:pp)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/practioner-programmer.png")
```

## RStudio {#rstudio}

Let's begin by learning about [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), the
Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

**R is the language and RStudio is software created to facilitate our use of R.**
They are installed separately. You don't need RStudio to use R, but you do need
R to used RStudio.

We will use R Studio IDE to write code, navigate the files found on our computer,
inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will
generate. R Studio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control,
developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that we don't have time to cover during
this workshop.

R Studio is divided into "Panes", see Figure \@ref(fig:rstudio).

When you first open it, there are three panes,the console where you type 
commands, your environment/history (top-right), and your
files/plots/packages/help/viewer (bottom-right).

The environment shows all the R objects you have created or are using, such
as data you have imported.

The output pane can be used to view any plots you have created.

Not opened at first start up is the fourth default pane: the script editor pane, 
but this will open as soon as we create/edit a R script (or many other document types). 
*The script editor is where will be typing much of the time.*

(ref:rstudio) The RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

```{r rstudio,fig.cap='(ref:rstudio)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_ide_image.png")
```

The placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see menu, 
R Studio -> Tools -> Global Options -> Pane Layout). One of the advantages of 
using R Studio is that all the information you need to write code is available 
in a single window. Additionally, with many short-cuts, auto-completion, and 
highlighting for the major file types you use while developing in R, R Studio 
will make typing easier and less error-prone.

> RStudio has lots of keyboard short-cuts to make coding quicker and easier.
Try to find the menu listing all the keyboard short-cuts, including the short-cut
to find the menu!

Time for another philosophical diversion...

### What is real?

At the start, we might consider our environment "real" - that is to say the objects
we've created/loaded and are using are "real". But it's much better in the long run
to consider our scripts as "real" - our scripts are where we write down the code
that creates our objects that we'll be using in our environment.

**As a script is a document, it is reproducible**

Or to put it another way: we can easily recreate an environment from our scripts, 
but not so easily create a script from an environment.

To support this notion of thinking in terms of our scripts as real, we recommend
turning off the preservation of workspaces between sessions by setting the 
Tools > Global Options menu in R studio as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:workspace).

(ref:turn-off) Don't save your workspace, save your script instead.

```{r workspace, fig.cap='(ref:turn-off)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rdata_turn_off.png")
```

### Where am I? {#file-structure}

The part of your computer operating system that manages files and directories (aka folders)
is called the file system. This dates back to 1969 and the [Unix filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem).

The idea is that we have a rooted tree, as with [phylogenetic rooted trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree#Rooted_tree) in biology.
From the root all other directories and files exist along paths going back to 
the root as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:abs-path).

On Unix based systems such as Apple or Android, the root is denoted with `/`. On
Windows the root is a back slash `\`. The `/` or `\`  is used to
to separate directories along the path, denoting a change in the level of the tree

**Note: in RStudio the path separator and root is always `/` regardless of the operating system.**

#### Absolute path from the root `/`

In Figure \@ref(fig:abs-path) the absolute path from the root of `surveys.csv` is shown. In
text this would be `/users/alistair/Documents/coding-together-week-02/data/surveys.csv`.

This is just a made-up example and the path on your machine will be different.

(ref:abs-path) The red line shows the absolute path from the root `/` to `surveys.csv`.

```{r abs-path,fig.cap='(ref:abs-path)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '100%', fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/abs-filepath-23-10-2019.png")
```

#### Relative path from where you are `../`

However, we can also consider relative paths, that is relative to where we are
working at present.

In Figure \@ref(fig:rel-path) I imagine that I am working in the `R` directory
in `coding-together-week-01` folder. To access the `surveys.csv` file I have to go up
two levels to `Documents` and then back down three levels. I could use the 
absolute path, but *if* I know where `surveys.csv` is then I can use the short-hand of `../`
to go up one level, and then again to go up another, and then back down.

In text from the `R` directory this is: `../../coding-together-week-02/data/surveys.csv`

I don't reccomend this, it was just to illustrate what a relative path looks like.

(ref:rel-path) The red line represents the relative path from `R` to `surveys.csv`

```{r rel-path,fig.asp=1,fig.cap='(ref:rel-path)', out.width= '100%', fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rel-filepath-23-10-2019.png")
```


#### Home directory path `~`

The home directory is the part of the file system dedicated to the user - that's us! -
and our data. Usually when we get a new computer we'll have a home directory with 
our user name. On Windows machines this will contain `My Documents` etc. and on 
an Apple machine it will be `Documents` etc. On a shared machine each user will
get a home directory associated with their user name.

Because we are usually working in our home directory and it's tiresome to keep 
typing out paths from the root and it takes up room on the screen, the tilde `~` denotes the 
path from the root to our home directory. 

We can use the `~` to precede the rest of the path to shortcut an absolute path to the root.

Figure \@ref(fig:home-path) indicates a home directory path to the 
`surveys.csv` with the `~` part in blue and the remaining path in red.

In text this would be: `~/Documents/coding-together-week-02/data/surveys.csv`

(ref:home-path) The home directory path to the 
`surveys.csv` with the `~` part in blue and the remaining path in red.


```{r home-path,fig.asp=1,fig.cap='(ref:home-path)', out.width= '100%', fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/home-filepath-23-10-2019.png")
```

#### Working directory 

R studio tells you where you are in terms of directory address as shown in 
Figure \@ref(fig:working-directory). Here this is a home directory path.

(ref:working-dir) Your working directory

```{r working-directory,fig.cap='(ref:working-dir)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_working_directory.png")
```

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
self-contained in a single folder, called **your working directory**. All of the
scripts within this folder can then use *relative paths* to files that indicate
where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to absolute paths, which
point to where a file is on a specific computer). An example
directory structure is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:dir-structure).
Working this way makes it a lot easier to move your project around on your computer.
Section \@ref(workflow) builds upon this to create a robust workflow for data analysis.

(ref:dir-structure) A typical directory structure

```{r dir-structure,fig.cap='(ref:dir-structure)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/R-ecology-work_dir_structure.png")
```

## Installing and loading packages {#install-packages}

Packages are collections of functions, and a function is a piece of code written
to perform a specific task, such as installing a package.

Therefore, the function `install.packages()` is a piece of code written to
perform the task of installing packages. We use it by typing `install.packages("tidyverse")`
with the name of the package in quotes inside the round brackets. Here
the package is `tidyverse`. Using the console
panel to type this and pressing `Enter` will run the function.

We of course need to know the name of the packages we are interested in.

Once a package is installed we need to load it into our environment to use it.
Loading packages is performed using the `library()` function. As with 
installation, we put the name of the package we want to load in between 
the round brackets like so `library(tidyverse)`. As before this can be done on 
the console, but we will usually load packages as part of script.
*Note that we don't need the quotes for the library function.*

> Try installing the `cowsay` package and loading it. It has one function
called `say()` that you can use to create messages with animals.

## Using functions {#functions-1}

As stated in \@ref(install-packages) a function is a piece of code written
to perform a specific task. Functions in R have the syntax of the name of the function
followed by round brackets. The round brackets are where we type the arguments 
that the function requires to carry out its task. For example, in \@ref(install-packages)
the function `install.packages()` requires the name of the package we want to 
install as arguments.

Many, if not most, functions can take more than one argument. The creators of the 
function should have given these defaults for the situation where the user provides
only one or some arguments. RStudio should prompt you for the arguments as you
type, but if you need to see what they are, use the help function `?` with the
function name in the Console and it will open the help panel or type the function 
name into the help panel search box.

For example, to find out all the arguments for `install.packages()` we'd
type `?install.packages` and press `Enter`.

> Try using `say()` to say "I are programmer" in the `cowsay` package and then 
find out what the arguments you can provide to make it produce different types of message.

## Getting help {#getting-help}

### Using `?` to access R function help pages

If you need help with a specific R function, let's say `barplot()`, you can type
the function name without round brackets, with a question mark at the start:

```{r barplot, eval=FALSE}
?barplot
```

### Using Google to find R answers

A Google or internet search "R \<task\>" will often either send you to the appropriate package documentation or a helpful forum question that someone else already asked,
such as the [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r).

### Asking questions

As well as knowing [where to ask](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#where-to-ask), the key to get help 
from someone is for them to grasp your problem rapidly. You
should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the issue might be.

Try to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a 
package is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand 
what you meant, but others have really strong feelings about the difference
in meaning. The key point is that it can make things confusing for people 
trying to help you. Be as precise as possible when describing your problem.

If possible, try to reduce what doesn't work to a simple *reproducible
example* otherwise known as a *reprex*. 

For more information on how to write a reproducible example see 
[this article](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) using the `reprex` package.

## A project orientated workflow {#workflow}

This section is all about how to use R and RStudio to **"maximize effectiveness and reduce frustration."**

The above quote is from [Jenny Bryan's article](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) 
about a project orientated workflow.

The main point here is that how you do things, **the workflow**, should not be 
mixed up with the **product of the workflow** itself. 

The product being:

+ the raw data.
+ the code needed to produce the results from the raw data.

Ways in which you can mix workflow and product include having lines in your script
that set your working directory, or using RStudio to save your environment when
you are working.

**But why is this a problem?**

It's because **your computer isn't my computer** or **my laptop isn't my desktop**
or **I'm now using a Windows machine and I wrote the code two years ago on a Mac**.

By hard coding the directory into a script I have ensured my code will only run 
on the machine in which it was written. Chances are you will want to share your 
code with someone, either for publication or for them to check your work, or 
because you are working collaboratively and therefore we need to avoid mixing
workflow with product.

Likewise we can't share environments directly, but we can share the code that
creates the environment.

If we organise our analysis into self-contained projects that hold everything
needed to perform the analysis. These projects can be shared across machines and the analysis
recreated, and thus the workflow is kept separate from the product.

What does this look like in practice?

### RStudio Projects

Step one is to use an interactive development environment such as RStudio rather
than using R on its own for your analysis.

RStudio contains a facility to keep all files associated with a particular 
analysis together called, as you might expect from \@ref(workflow), a Project.

Creating a Project creates a file `.Rproj` containing all the information associated
with your analysis including the Project location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it),
and optionally preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to resume work after a
break. This is also super helpful if you are working on multiple projects as you can
switch between them at a click.

(ref:r-project) Creating a R project

```{r r-projects,fig.cap='(ref:r-project)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_create_project.PNG")
```

Below, we will go through the steps for creating an `Project`:

* Start R Studio (presentation of R Studio -below- should happen here)
* Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
  `Empty project`
* Enter a name for this new folder (or "directory", in computer science), and
  choose a convenient location for it. This will be your **working directory**
  for the rest of the day (e.g., `~/coding-together`)
* Click on "Create project"
* Under the `Files` tab on the right of the screen, click on `New Folder` and
  create a folder named `data` within your newly created working directory. (e.g., `~/data`)
* Create a R notebook (File > New File > R notebook) and save it in your working
  directory (e.g. `01-coding-together-workshop-02-05-2019.Rmd`)
* Or create a new R script (File > New File > R script) and save it in your working
  directory (e.g. `01-coding-together-workshop-02-05-2019.R`)
  
### R notebooks and R scripts

[R notebooks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html) combine writing 
text with R code in chunks. The R code chunks are indicated by three backticks and
a lowercase r in brackets: ` ```{r} ``` `.  Text can be formatted using
[markdown syntax](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html). 
These are great for doing analysis
and report wrting at the same time.

R scripts are text files containing the commands that you would enter into the R
console. They are great for containing code you wish to call into another script
such as code for a function, or if you are submitting a script as job to run
on another computer without the need for RStudio.
  
### Level up with the `here` package  {#here}

This is a bit more tricky, so you might like to come back to `here` later, but 
Jenny Bryan loves the [`here`](https://here.r-lib.org/index.html) package by 
Kirill Müller so much [she wrote an ode to it](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here).

In a nutshell, the `here()` function sets the path implicitly to the top level of the R project
you are working in. **But what does that mean, and why should I care?**

Using the `here()` function like this:

`library(here)`

`here("data", "file_i_want.csv")`

where `"data"` is the folder containing  `"file_i_want.csv"`, the function works
out the rest of the path to the folder and file. This is useful if you open the 
project on different machines where the path is different. `here()` takes care of 
things, thus saving you some pain.

### Naming things {#names}
  
[Jenny Bryan](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/12/08/rprofile-jenny-bryan/)
also has three principles for [naming things](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf) 
that are well worth remembering.

When you names something, a file or an object, ideally it should be:
  
1. Machine readable (no white space, punctuation, upper AND lower-case...)
2. Human readable  (makes sense in 6 months or 2 years time)
3. Plays well with default ordering (numerical or date order)

We'll see examples of this as we go along.

## The tidyverse and tidy data {#tidy-data}

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) [@R-tidyverse] is *"an opinionated 
collection of R packages designed for data science"* . 

Tidyverse packages contain functions that *"share an underlying design 
philosophy, grammar, and data structures."* It's this philosophy that makes 
tidyverse functions and packages relatively easy to learn and use.

Tidy data follows three principals for tabular data as proposed in the Tidy Data 
paper http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper :

1. Every variable has its own column.
2. Every observation has its own row.
3. Each value has its own cell.

We'll be using the tidyverse and learning more about tidy data as we go along.

## Atoms of R {#r-atoms}

Having set ourselves up in RStudio, let's turn our attention to the language of
R itself.

The basic building blocks of how R stores data are called atomic vector types. 
It's from these atoms that more complex structures are built. Atomic vectors
have one dimension, just like a single row or a single column in a spreadsheet.

The four main atoms of R are: 

+ Doubles: regular numbers, +ve or -ve and with or without decimal places. AKA numerics.
+ Integers: whole numbers, specified with an upper-case L, e.g. `int <- 2L`
+ Characters: Strings of text
+ Logicals: these store `TRUE`'s and `FALSE`'s' which are useful for comparisons.

(ref:atomic-vectors) The four most used atomic vectors, the building blocks of R

```{r atomic-vectors,fig.cap='(ref:atomic-vectors)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '50%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/r-vectors-07-10-2018.png")
```


Let's make a character vector and check the atomic vector type, using the `typeof()`.
This also introduces a very important R function `c()`. This lower case c stands
for **combine**. So when we have several objects e.g. words or numbers, we can
combine them into a vector the length of the number of objects, as illustrated
here for a pack of cards:

```{r cards-characters}
cards <- c("ace", "king", "queen", "jack", "ten")

cards

typeof(cards)
```

Note here that we see the use of the assignment operator `<-` to assign our 
vector on the right as the object `cards`. We talk more about that in \@ref(assignment).

> Try creating a vector of numbers from 1 to 10 using the seq() function. Remember
to use ?seq if you want to learn more about the function.

## Assigning objects {#assignment}

Objects are just a way to store data inside the R environment. We assign labels to
objects using the assignment operator `<-`

```{r mass-kg}
mass_kg <- 55
```

Read this as *"mass_kg is assigned to value 55"* in your head. A subtle but important
point here is that the object is 55 and the value remains 55 regardless of the label we assign to it. In
fact we could assign more than one label to the same object. Another way to think 
about this is that Bibi is a cat, and remains a cat even if I call her Princess when
she refuses to go out in the rain.

(ref:bibi-cat) Bibi remains a cat even if I call her Princess when she refuses to go out in the rain.

```{r bibi-cat,fig.cap='(ref:bibi-cat)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/bibi-data.png")
```

Using `<-` can be annoying to type, so use RStudio’s keyboard short cut: 
Alt + - (the minus sign) to make life easier. 

Many people ask why we use this assignment operator when we can use `=` instead?

[Colin Fay had a Twitter thread on this subject](https://twitter.com/_colinfay/status/1006139974377443328),
but the reason I favour most is that it provides clarity. The arrow points in 
the direction of the assignment (it is actually possible to assign in the other
direction too) and it distinguishes between creating an object in the workspace 
and assigning a value inside a function.

Object name style is a matter of choice, but must start with a letter and can 
only contain letters, numbers, `_` and `.`. We recommend using descriptive names
and using `_` between words. Some special symbols cannot be used in variable 
names, so watch out for those.

So here we've used the name to indicate its value represents a mass in kilograms. 
Look in your environment pane and you'll see the `mass_kg` object 
containing the (data) value 55.

We can inspect an object by typing it's name:

```{r mass-inspect}
mass_kg
```

What's wrong here?

```{r mass-wrong-name, eval=FALSE}
mass_KG
```
`Error: object 'mass_KG' not found`

This error illustrates that typos matter, everything must be precise and `mass_KG`
is not the same as `mass_kg`. `mass_KG` doesn't exist, hence the error.

Let's use `seq()` to create a **seq**uence of numbers, and at the same time practice tab completion.

Start typing `se` in the console and you should see a list of functions appear,
add `q` to shorten the list, then use the up and down arrow to highlight the function
of interest `seq()` and hit Tab to select. This is tab completion.

RStudio puts the cursor between the parentheses to prompt us to enter some 
arguments. Here we'll use 1 as the start and 10 as the end:

```{r sequence-function}
seq(1,10)
```

If we left off a parentheses to close the function, then when we hit enter 
we'll see a `+` indicating RStudio is expecting further code. We either add the 
missing part or press Escape to cancel the code.

Let's call a function and make an assignment at the same time. Here we'll use
the base R function `seq()` which takes three arguments: `from`, `to` and `by`.

Read the following code as *"assign my_sequence to an object that stores a sequence of numbers from 2 to 20 by intervals of 2*.

```{r sequence-object}
my_sequence <- seq(2,20,2)
```

This time nothing was returned to the console, but we now have an object called
`my_sequence` in our environment.

### Indexing and subsetting

If we want to access and subset elements of `my_sequence` we use 
square brackets `[]` and the index number. Indexing in R starts at 1 such that 
1 is the index of the first element in the sequence, element 1 having the the value of 2.

For example element five would be subset by:

```{r sequence-element}
my_sequence[5]
```

Here the number five is the index of the vector, not the value of the fifth element. The value of the fifth element is 10. 

And returning multiple elements uses a colon `:`, like so

```{r sequence-range}
my_sequence[5:8]
```

## Lists, matrices and arrays

Lists also group data into one dimensional sets of data. The difference being 
that list group objects instead of individual values, such as several atomic 
vectors.

For example, let's make a list containing a vector of numbers and a character
vector

```{r list-example}
list_1 <- list(1:110,"R")

list_1
```

Note the double brackets to indicate the list elements, i.e. element one is the
vector of numbers and element two is a vector of a single character.

We won't be working with lists a great deal in these workshops, but they are a flexible way to 
store data of different types in R. 

Accessing list elements uses double square brackets syntax, for example
`list_1[[1]]` would return the first vector in our list. 

And to access the first element in the first vector would combine double and
single square brackets like so: `list_1[[1]][1]`.

Don't worry if you find this confusing, everyone does when they first start with
R. Hadley Wickham tweeted an image to illustrate list indexing shown in \@ref(fig:list-index).

(ref:list-index) List indexing by Hadley Wickham

```{r list-index, fig.cap='(ref:list-index)',out.width = '100%', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/indexing.png")
```

Lists alongside `NULL` which indicates the absence of a vector, complete the set
of base vectors in R as illustrated in \@ref(fig:base-vectors).

(ref:base-vectors) The base vectors in R.

```{r base-vectors, fig.cap='(ref:base-vectors)',out.width='60%', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/r-all-vectors-07-10-2018.png")
```

### Matrices and arrays

Matrices store values in a two dimensional array, whilst arrays can have n 
dimensions. We won't be using these either, but they are also valid R objects.

## Factors {#factors}

Factors are Rs way of storing categorical information such as eye colour or
car type. A factor is something that can only have certain values, and can be
ordered (such as `low`,`medium`,`high`) or unordered such as types of fruit.

Factors are useful as they code string variables such as "red" or "blue" to integer 
values e.g. 1 and 2, which can be used in statistical models and when plotting, 
but they are confusing as they look like strings. 

**Factors look like strings, but behave like integers.**

Historically R converts strings to factors when we load and create data, but 
it's often not what we want as a default. Fortunately, in the tidyverse strings
are not treated as factors by default.

## Data frames {#data-frames}

For data analysis in R, we mostly be using data frames.

Data frames are two dimensional versions of lists, and this is form of storing
data we are going to be using. In a data frame each atomic vector type becomes
a column, and a data frame is formed by columns of vectors of the same length.
Each column element must be of the same type, but the column types can vary.

Figure \@ref(fig:df) shows an example data frame we'll refer to as
saved as the object `df` consisting of three rows and three columns. Each 
column is a different atomic data type of the same length.

(ref:df) An example data frame `df`.


```{r df,fig.cap='(ref:df)', fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data_frame.png")
```

To create the data frame \@ref(fig:df) we can use the `data.frame()` function
in conjunction with the `c()` function to make the individual atomic vectors
that comprise the data frame as follows. Note that I am naming the vectors as I make
the data frame after the type of vector e.g. `numeric_vector = c(1,7,3)`. Also,
as this is a base R function I need to tell the function not to treat the character
strings as categorical data using `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`


```{r make-data-frame}
df <- data.frame(numeric_vector = c(1,7,3), 
                 character_vector = c("S","A","U"),
                 logical_vector = c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE), 
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

df
```

Packages in the  tidyverse create a modified form of data frame called a tibble.
You can read about tibbles [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html). One 
advantage of tibbles is that they don't default to treating strings as factors. 
We deal with transforming data frames in chapters \@ref(data-wrangle-1) and \@ref(data-wrangle-2).

Here's what the code to make the same data frame as before as a tibble looks like.
Note how we get more information from a tibble when it is returned to the Console,
it tells us what the dimensions are, and what type of vectors it contains.

```{r make-tibble}
df <- tibble(numeric_vector = c(1,7,3), 
                 character_vector = c("S","A","U"),
                 logical_vector = c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE))

df
```

Sub-setting data frames can also be done with square bracket syntax, but as we
have both rows and columns, we need to provide index values for both row and 
column.

For example `df[1,2]` means **return the value of `df` row 1, column 2**. This corresponds with the value `A`. 

We can also use the colon operator to choose
several rows or columns, and by leaving the row or column blank we return all 
rows or all columns.

```{r subset-df, eval=FALSE}
# Subset rows 1 and 2 of column 1
df[1:2,1]

# Subset all rows of column 3
df[,3]
```

Don't worry too much about this for now, we won't be doing to much of this
in these lessons, but it's worth being aware of this syntax.

### Attributes 

An attribute is a piece of information you can attach to an object, such as
names or dimensions. Attributes such as dimensions are added when 
we create an object, but others such as names can be added.

Let's look at the `mpg` data frame dimensions:

```{r attributes}
# mpg has 234 rows (observations) and 11 columns (variables)
dim(mpg)
```

## Plotting data

One of the most useful and important parts of any data analysis is plotting 
data. We'll be spending a whole lesson on it in chapter \@ref(viz), but to 
give you an example, we'll use the `ggplot2` package as an introduction to 
automating a task in code, and as a tool for understanding data.

`ggplot2` implements the *grammar of graphics*, for describing
and building graphs. The idea being that we construct a plot in the following way:

1. Call the `ggplot()` function to create a graph.
2. Pass our data as the first argue to the `ggplot()` function.
3. Then pass some arguments to the aesthetics function `aes()` inside 
the `gpplot()` which tell ggplot how to plot the data e.g. which data goes on the x and y axis.
4. Then we follow the ggplot function with a `+` sign to indicate
we are going to add more code, followed by a geometric object function, a `geom`
which maps the data to type of plot we want to make e.g. a histogram or scatter plot.

Don't worry if this sounds confusing, it becomes clear with practice and all plots 
follow this grammar.

We'll use the `mpg` dataset that comes with the tidyverse to examine
the question *do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?*

Try `?mpg` to learn more about the data.

1. Engine size in litres is in the `displ` column.
2. Fuel efficiency on the highway in miles per gallon is given in the `hwy` column.

To create a plot of engine size `displ` (x-axis) against fuel efficiency `hwy` 
(y-axis)  we do the following:

Now try extending this code to include to add a `colour` aesthetic to the
the `aes()` function, let `colour = class`, `class` being the vehicle type.
This should create a plot with as before but with the points coloured
according to the vehicle type to expand our understanding.

```{r, mpg-plot-2}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class))
```

Now we can see that as we might expect, bigger cars such as SUVs tend to have 
bigger engines and are also less fuel efficient, but some smaller cars such as 
2-seaters also have big engines and greater fuel efficiency. Hence we have a 
more nuanced view with this additional aesthetic.

Check out the ggplot2 documentation for all the aesthetic possibilities (and 
Google for examples): http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/

So now we have re-usable code snippet for generating plots in R:

```{r, purl=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

Concretely, in our first example `<DATA>` was `mpg`, the `<GEOM_FUNCTION>` 
was `geom_point()` and the arguments we supplies to map our aesthetics 
`<MAPPINGS>` were `x = displ, y = hwy`.

As we can use this code for any tidy data set, hopefully you are beginning to 
see how a small amount of code can do a lot.


## Exporting data

We'll spend more time on getting data in and out of our R environment in the 
next chapter \@ref(data-wrangle-2), but just to wrap this lesson up let's imagine
we wanted to export our plot and data for a colleague or presentation.

### readr

To export tibbles and data frames, we'll use the `readr` package, and the
`write_excel_csv()` function. This creates a table in comma separated variable
format that can opened by spreadsheet software such as excel. 

As it is a function
is has round brackets and the main arguments we pass are the object containing
the data we want to output and the name of the file and the location we want to
write the file to.

```{r write-data, eval=FALSE}
write_excel_csv(df, "outputs/example-data-02-05-2019.csv")
```

Here we are writing the `df` data frame as a csv file to the `outputs` folder
and a file called `example-data-02-05-2019.csv`.

### ggsave

If we want to save the last plot we made in `ggplot2` we can use the [`ggsave()`
function](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html) 

We tell `ggsave()` the filename, and it will save it as that type depending
on how we name the file. For example if we use `file.pdf` it will save a PDF and
if we use `file.jpeg` it will save a `jpeg`.

Check out `?ggsave` or the line above for more options.

To save our last plot for example:

```{r ggsave, eval=FALSE}
ggsave("outputs/example-plot-02-05-2019.pdf")
```

### Exercise

> 1. Create a new project called 'coding-assessment-01'
2. Create two folders in this project: R and outputs
3. Create a R script using best naming practices i.e. name-date.R
4. In the script, write some comments at the top e.g. name, date, description
5. Create a tibble comprising of a character vector, a numeric vector
6. Install and load the `dslabs` package and create a density plot with ggplot2 using the
`heights` dataset, using the `x = height` variable and `fill = sex` to create a density plot
    ggplot(data = heights, aes(x =height, fill = sex)) + geom_density()
7. Save the plot as pdf and the tibble as csv file to the output folder.

# Data wrangling I {#data-wrangle-1}

By the end of this chapter you will:

+ have learnt to load csv files
+ have used the key verbs of the `dplyr` package for transforming data to
arrange and filter observations, select variables, create new variables, and
create summaries.
+ have learnt how to combine functions with the pipe `%>%` from the `magrittr` package 
to combine tasks

The following sections are based upon the [data transformation chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) in R4DS and the 
[Data Carpentry ecology lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html).

## Data organisation in spreadsheets

Karl Broman and Kara Woo wrote as 
paper all about [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989).

It's full of practical advice and context and well worth reading for helping
you think about best practices for organising your data for yourself, and when working with others. 

### Flat formats and Excel files

File formats like `.csv` and `.tsv`, comma separated variables and tab separated variables
respectively are plain text files. That is to 
say they contain only the data, as text information, and are the simplest and most 
convenient way to share data as most software can read and 
interpret them.

Excel files saves files into its own proprietary format `.xls` or `.xlsx` that holds 
information in addition to the data itself. For reading and
writing excel files in R, the tidyverse `readxl` package is very useful.

## The Portal Project data {#portal-project}

In this chapter we are going to focus on data from the [Portal Project](https://portal.weecology.org/),
which is a long running survey of rodents and other species in the Chihuahuan Desert,
as analysed in the 1994 paper by Heske et. al: 

**Long-Term Experimental Study of a Chihuahuan Desert Rodent Community: 13 Years 
of Competition**, DOI: 10.2307/1939547.

[A paper with details about the data and the project](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/332783v1.full) is also available.

Specifically they explored the effect on the populations of small
seed eating rodents as a result of the exclusion of larger competitor kangaroo 
rats over a period from 1977 to 1991.

We'll also use some of their data to explore this question: **What is the effect 
of the exclusion of kangaroo rats from a plot of land on the granivore population?**

Figure \@ref(fig:k-rat) shows an image of one of the species of kangaroo rats excluded during the
study.

(ref:krat) [Merriam's kangaroo rat, Dipodomys merriami](https://portalproject.wordpress.com/)


```{r k-rat, fig.cap='(ref:krat)',fig.asp=1,out.width = '100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/kratsep12.jpg")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:fence) indicates how the exclusion works, where a for number of
fenced plots the kangaroo rats were either able to enter by a hole or kept out.

(ref:fence) Kangaroo Rat exclusion

```{r fence,  fig.cap='(ref:fence)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '60%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/fence_hole.JPG")
```

The plots are 50 metres by 50 metres, and a survey of the species within each
plot has been ongoing once a month for many years.

The dataset is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file.
Each row holds information for a single animal, and the columns represent:

| Column           | Description                        | Type      |
|------------------|------------------------------------|-----------|
| record\_id       | Unique id for the observation      | numeric   |
| month            | month of observation               | numeric   |
| day              | day of observation                 | numeric   |
| year             | year of observation                | numeric   |
| plot\_id         | ID of a particular plot            | numeric   |
| species\_id      | 2-letter code                      | character |
| sex              | sex of animal ("M", "F")           | character |
| hindfoot\_length | length of the hindfoot in mm       | numeric   |
| weight           | weight of the animal in grams      | numeric   |
| genus            | genus of animal                    | character |
| species          | species of animal                  | character |
| taxa             | e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit | character |
| plot\_type       | type of plot                       | character |

The rodents species surveyed are:

**Kangaroo Rats**                                                     

| species_id | Scientific name       | Common name                  |
|------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|

| PM         | Peromyscus maniculatus    | Deer Mouse               |
| RM         | Reithrodontomys megalotis | Western harvest mouse    |

### Downloading and importing the data 

**First create a [R project](#workflow) for this analysis e.g `coding-together-week-2`**

The dataset is stored on-line, so we use the utility function 
`download.file()` to download the csv file to our data folder. 
(Did you create a data folder in the project directory?)

Here we pass the `url = ` and `destfile = ` arguments to `download.file()`.

As we have the `tidyverse` packages we can use the `readr` package it contains, 
which has many functions for reading files, including `read_csv()`.
The advantage of `read_csv()` over base R `read.csv()` is that it defaults to reading strings as
character vectors rather than factors (categorical variables) which 
is usually what we want.

As we read the data into our environment we need to assign a label 
to the object we are creating. Here we assign the dataset to an object 
called `surveys` using the `<-` assignment operator.

```{r download-portal-data, eval=FALSE}
# Download the data
download.file(url="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data/portal_data_joined.csv")

# Read into R as an object called surveys
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

## `dplyr`

[`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) *"is a grammar of data manipulation"*.
Concretely, it's a package of functions from the tidyverse that have been
created for tasks that require manipulation of data stored in [data frames](data-frames).

```{r dplyr-name, fig.cap="[Why is it called `dplyr`?](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/1857)",fig.asp=1, out.width= '100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr-name-github.png")
```


We're going to use the most common verbs in `dplyr` to examine the Portal Project
surveys data.

### Filter rows with `filter()`

The first verb to consider is the `filter()` function which enables us to subset observations
based on their value.

Consider the surveys data and sub-setting observations that only occurred from
1985 onwards. It's fairly natural to say *"filter the survey where the year
variable is equal or greater than 1985"*. And indeed this is how we use `filter()`
as a verb. 

Figure \@ref(fig:dplyr-filter) shows how 
we give the filter function two arguments. The first is the
data frame, the second is the variable and condition on which we wish to filter.

An alternative way to use `filter()` is to "pipe" the function using pipe `%>%` from the `magrittr` package 
which you can think of as using the word *"then"*. We take our data set *then* filter it. 
Using the pipe makes more sense when combining several operations.

> Ctl+Shift+M is a keyboard short cut to create a pipe.

For the filter itself, from R4DS:

*"To use filtering effectively, you have to know how to select the observations t
hat you want using the comparison operators. R provides the standard suite: `>`, 
`>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal)....For other types of combinations, 
you’ll need to use Boolean operators yourself: `&` is “and”, `|` is “or”, and `!` is “not”."*

See [Figure 5.1](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#fig:bool-ops) in R4DS for
to see how these operators work.

(Note that we aren't assigning the output to an object here, so we can see it.)

(ref:filter) `dplyr::filter()`

```{r dplyr-filter, fig.cap='(ref:filter)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr_filter.png")
```


```{r filter}
# Filter observations that only occurred from 1985 onwards
 filter(surveys, year >= 1985)
```

An example using Boolean logic, would be to use the "or" operator `|` to filter
for the observations only occurring on `plot_type`'s control or long term kangaroo 
rat exclusion. This time we assign the output to a new data frame called `surveys_filtered`.

**Note:** as `plot_type` is a character vector we put the terms in quotes,
and also the double equals sign `==` "for equal to".

```{r surveys-filtered}
# Keep only the rows corresponding with the Control and Long-term Krat Exclosure
surveys_filtered <- surveys %>% 
        filter(plot_type == "Control" | plot_type == "Long-term Krat Exclosure")
```

**Note:** `filter()` only includes rows where the condition is TRUE; it excludes both `FALSE` and missing `NA` values.
We have to explicitly ask to keep `NA` values using `is.na()` as an additional filter.

> How did I know which `plot_type`'s to filter? 
I used the `dplyr::distinct()` function, passing the `surveys` data frame
and the `plot_type` variable to obtain a list of the unique plot types, 
from which I determined the `Control` and `Long-term Krat Exclosure` plots
were the ones I was after. Note that you need to add the argument
`.keep_all = TRUE` to `distinct()` to return all the columns in the 
data frame

```{r distinct}
distinct(surveys, plot_type)
```


### Arrange rows with `arrange()`

The next verb is `arrange()` which also operates on the rows, and enables
you to arrange the observations in a data frame according to one or more variables.

As with `filter()` we supply the variable or variables of interest as the arguments
to `arrange()`.

From [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#arrange-rows-with-arrange): 

*"If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to 
break ties in the values of preceding columns...
Missing values are always sorted at the end."*

Figure \@ref(fig:dplyr-arrange) shows how to arrange the observations according to the `record_id` 
variable.

(ref:arrange) `dplyr::arrange()`

```{r dplyr-arrange, fig.cap='(ref:arrange)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr_arrange.png")
```

```{r arrange-record_id}
surveys %>% arrange(record_id)
```

Or we could use `arrange()` to find the record with the shortest hindfoot. 
*Note:* `arrange()` defaults to ascending order.

```{r arrange-short-foot}
surveys %>% arrange(hindfoot_length)
```

To find the Cactus Mouse, (`species_id == "PE"`) with the longest hindfoot we combine
`filter()` with `arrangee()` using the pipe:

*Hint* Use the `desc()` function to arrange from biggest to smallest.

```{r arrange-cactus-mouse}
surveys %>% 
        filter(species_id == "PE") %>% 
        arrange(desc(hindfoot_length))
```

### Select columns with `select()`

Often your data contains variables you don't need for the analysis you are performing, or you want to subset them to share with others.
To select only the ones you need, or explore subsets of the variables, the 
`select()` verb enables you to keep only the columns of interest.

Figure \@ref(fig:dplyr-select) shows the use of `select()` to choose only
the `year` and `plot_type` columns, with or without the pipe.

Selecting the variables contained in the columns can be done in various ways. 
For example, by the column number, the variable name or by range. 
Check the help function `?select` for more options.

(ref:select) `dplyr::select()`

```{r dplyr-select, fig.cap='(ref:select)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr_select.png")
```

```{r select}
# Select the year and plot type columns
surveys %>% select(year,plot_type)
```

We can also use negative selection by adding a minus sign `-` to variables we
wish to discard. Here we discard `sex`,`hindfoot_length` and `weight` from the
`surveys_filtered` object and keep everything else:

```{r}
# Select everything except sex, hindfoot and weight
surveys_filtered %>% select(-sex,-hindfoot_length,-weight)
```


### Create new variables with `mutate()`

Another common task is to create a new variable or variables, often from existing data
within the data frame. For this we use the `mutate()` verb. It follows the 
same syntax as for `filter()`, `arrange()` and `select()` in that the first
argument is the dataset, and the subsequent arguments are the new variables we wish
to create.

Figure \@ref(fig:dplyr-mutate) shows how to create a new variable `weight_kg` by
dividing the existing `weight` variable in grams by 1000.

(ref:mutate) `dplyr::mutate()`

```{r dplyr-mutate, fig.cap='(ref:mutate)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr-mutate-16-10-2019.png")
```

A more complicated mutation, and key to to our analysis exploring the question
as to whether Kangaroo rats effect the size of the granivore population would
be to create a variable that indicates which type of rodent an observation is
recording.

To do this we can make use of another `dplyr` function called `case_when()`. 
This allows us to pass different values to our new `rodent_type` variable **if**
they match either `species_id` values corresponding with Kangaroo rats or Granivores.

To remind us, the rodents species surveyed are:

**Kangaroo Rats**                                                     

| species_id | Scientific name       | Common name                  |
|------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| DM         | Dipodomys merriami    | Merriam's kangaroo rat       |
| DO         | Dipodomys ordii       | Ord's kangaroo rat           |
| DS         | Dipodomys spectabilis | Banner-tailed kangaroo rat   |

**Granivores**                                                        

| species_id | Scientific name           | Common name              |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| PP         | Chaetodipus penicillatus  | Desert pocket mouse      |
| PF         | Perognathus flavus        | Silky pocket mouse       |
| PE         | Peromyscus eremicus       | Cactus mouse             |
| PM         | Peromyscus maniculatus    | Deer Mouse               |
| RM         | Reithrodontomys megalotis | Western harvest mouse    |

The first argument to `case_when()` is the variable and value we want to match,
just like `filter()`, for example `species_id == "DM"`, and then we use the tilde
operator `~` followed by the value we want give our new variable **if** a we match
this condition. Here we want our new variable `rodent_type` to be "Kangaroo Rat".

We do this for every case we want to match. There are other species than rodents 
in this data, and we have choice to either provide values for each one, ignore them
which will lead to the value `NA` for those rows or we can supply a single value 
to the rest by giving the argument `TRUE` followed by the value. This means if
there are other values in `species_id` - if this is true - then give them all the
same value. Here we supply the value "Other" for the remaining species: `TRUE ~ "Other"`.

Below is how this looks in practice and is assigned to a new `surveys_mutated` object.

```{r}
# Mutate surveys_filtered
surveys_mutated <- surveys_filtered %>%
  # Create rodent type variable for K-rats and Granivores.Everything else, Other.
  mutate(rodent_type = case_when(
         species_id == "DM" ~ "Kangaroo Rat",
         species_id == "DO" ~ "Kangaroo Rat",
         species_id == "DS" ~ "Kangaroo Rat",
         species_id == "PP" ~ "Granivore",
         species_id == "PF" ~ "Granivore",
         species_id == "PE" ~ "Granivore",
         species_id == "PM" ~ "Granivore",
         species_id == "RM" ~ "Granivore",
         TRUE ~ "Other"))

# Check output using distinct()
surveys_mutated %>% select(species_id,rodent_type) %>% 
        distinct(species_id, .keep_all = T)
```


### Grouped summaries with `group_by()` and `summarise()`

Finally we'll look at the verb `summarise()` and it's companion `group_by()`. 

`summarise()` collapses a data frame
into a single row. For example as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:dplyr-summarise), we 
could use it to find the average weight
of all the animals surveyed in the original data frame using `mean()`. (Here the
`na.rm = TRUE` argument is given to remove missing values from the data, 
otherwise R would return `NA` when trying to average.)

(ref:summarise) `dplyr::summarise()`

(ref:group-by) `dplyr::group_by()`

```{r dplyr-summarise, fig.cap='(ref:summarise)',out.width = '100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr-summarise-16-10-2019.png")
```

```{r summarise}
surveys %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

However `summarise()` is most useful when paired with `group_by()`
which defines the variables upon which we operate upon. 

Figure \@ref(fig:group-by) shows how by grouping the observations according to the
`sex` and `species_id` variables, we can then calculate the `mean_weight` for 
each of these groups.


```{r group-by, fig.cap='(ref:group-by)',fig.align='center',out.width = '100%', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr-group-by-16-10-2019.png")
```

Using `group_by()` with `summarise()` now returns a table with 92 rows instead of single row.

```{r grouped-summarise,  cache=TRUE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Using `dpylr` to explore the effect of Kangaroo Rat exclusion on Granivore populations

Let's use what we've learnt so far to explore the effect of Kangaroo Rats on Granivore populations
for the entire time covered in the `surveys` dataset. 

A line plot with time on the x-axis and number of rodents on the y-axis would be
one way to visual this, comparing the observations between the control plots and the Kangaroo
rat exclusion plots.

One way to do this is to:

1. `filter()` the observations for the control and exclusion plots.
2.  Create a new `rodent_type` variable for Kangaroo Rats and Granivores.
3.  Create a new variable for time from the existing `day`,`month` and `year` variables.
4.  Group the data according to the `rodent_type`, `plot_type` our time variable, and use `summarise()` to calculate the number of observations for each group. 

### Re-cap of `filter()` and `mutate()`

Let's re-cap steps one and two:

```{r surveys-recap, eval=FALSE}
# Keep only the rows corresponding with the Control and Long-term Krat Exclosure
surveys_filtered <- surveys %>% 
        filter(plot_type == "Control" | plot_type == "Long-term Krat Exclosure")

# Mutate surveys_filtered
surveys_mutated <- surveys_filtered %>%
  # Create rodent type variable for K-rats and Granivores.Everything else, Other.
  mutate(rodent_type = case_when(
         species_id == "DM" ~ "Kangaroo Rat",
         species_id == "DO" ~ "Kangaroo Rat",
         species_id == "DS" ~ "Kangaroo Rat",
         species_id == "PP" ~ "Granivore",
         species_id == "PF" ~ "Granivore",
         species_id == "PE" ~ "Granivore",
         species_id == "PM" ~ "Granivore",
         species_id == "RM" ~ "Granivore",
         TRUE ~ "Other"))
```

### Use `lubridate` to create new time variables

Step three introduces the tidyverse [`lubridate` package](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/). 
As the name suggests, this is a package for wrangling dates and times.

It would be clearer to plot the data on three month (quarterly) basis rather than
plotting every date in the dataset, so we need to create a variable that contains
the quarter in which the observation was made, for each observation.

From `lubridate` we will use the function `make_date()` in combination with `mutate()` 
first to create a single column `date` variable from the `day`,`month` and `year` variables. 
We then use this `date` variable to create another new variable containing a value for the 
quarter of the year in which the observation was made `quarter` using the `quarter()` function.

We'll assign this output to a new data frame called `surveys_subset`.

```{r lubridate-mutate, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  cache=TRUE}
library(lubridate)
surveys_subset <- surveys_mutated %>% 
        mutate(date = make_date(day = day, month = month, year = year), 
               quarter = quarter(date,with_year = TRUE))
```

### Group and summarise the data into quarterly observations

Step four is to group and summarise our quarterly observations. 

We group by `rodent_type`, `plot_type` and
`quarter` variables. In other words we've grouped the data according to Kangaroo Rat or
Granivore, Control plot or Exclusion plot, and the quarter of the year in which 
the observation occurred. 

Then we can calculate the number of captures for each of these groups by
using `summarise()` to create a `mean_captures` variable which is equal to the number
of rows for that group using the `n()` function divided by 4 to calculate
the average over each quarter.

**Note:** `n()` is a `dplyr` function that returns the number of observations in the current group.

```{r by-quarter,  cache=TRUE}
by_quarter <- surveys_subset %>% 
        group_by(rodent_type,plot_type,quarter) %>% 
        summarise(mean_captures = n()/4)

by_quarter
```

These steps have taken us from a table of 34,786 observations to a table of 567 observations.

### Create a plot with `ggplot` 

Now we can create a line and point plot, using the `by_quarter` data as our first `ggplot()` 
argument. 

For the aesthetics we are plotting the time on the
x-axis using the `quarter` variable, and the quarterly `mean_captures` on the
y-axis, and we colour the data by `rodent_type`.

Then we create line and point geometric mappings, and split the plot into two
facets using `facet_wrap` according to `plot_type`.

```{r plot-quarter-all,out.width = '100%', cache=TRUE}
ggplot(by_quarter,
       aes(x=quarter,y=mean_captures,colour=rodent_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ plot_type)
```

But it would be more useful to only plot the Kangaroo Rats and Granivores
data, so let's filter out the other species. And move the legend to the bottom
of the plot and add a title.

```{r plot-quarter, out.width = '100%',cache=TRUE}
by_quarter %>% 
        filter(rodent_type != "Other") %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x=quarter,y=mean_captures,colour=rodent_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ plot_type) +
        theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
        ggtitle("How does excluding Kangaroo Rats 
                effect Granivore populations?", 
                subtitle = "Mean quarterly observations")
```

# Data wrangling II {#data-wrangle-2}

Following on from chapter 2 this lesson deals with some 
common tidying problems with data using the [`tidyr` package](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) . By the end of this chapter the learner 
will:

+ have learnt how to transform rows and columns to reorganise data
+ have learnt how to join data contained in separate tables into a single table 
+ have learnt some ways to deal with missing values

## Reshaping data with pivots

As you will recall [tidy data](tidy-data) means that in a table:

1. Every variable has its own column.
2. Every observation has its own row.
3. Each value has its own cell.

Two common problems making your data untidy are that:

1. A single variable is spread across multiple colummns.
2. A single observation is distributed across multiple rows.

In the first case the column names are actually the variable we are 
interested in, making our table **wide**. 

In the second case, the observation is contained in several rows instead
of a single row, making our table **long**.

Hence `tidyr` has functions that **pivot** (as in turning) a table from **wide-to-long** by reducing the number of columns and increasing the number of rows. Or from **long-to-wide** by reducing the number of rows and increasing the number of columns.

Usually, the hard part is identifying in a dataset our variables and our 
observations, as it is not always obvious which is which.

### `tidyr::pivot_longer`

First we'll consider the case when our variable has been recorded as 
column names by returning to a version of the [Portal surveys data](portal-project). 

A table containing the mean weight of 10 rodent species on each plot from the rodent survey data 
can be read directly into a `surveys_spread` object using the code below.

```{r surveys-spread, eval=FALSE}
surveys_spread <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab604/ab604.github.io/master/docs/surveys_spread.csv")
```

Feel free to explore the data, and snapshot is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pivot-long).

Imagine that we recorded the mean weight of each rodent species on a plot in the field. 
It makes sense to put the species as column headings, along with the plot id and
then record the values in each cell.

However, really our variables of interest are the rodent species and our observational
units, the rows, should contain the mean weight for a rodent species in a plot. Hence we
need to reduce the number of columns and create a longer table.

To do this we `pivot_longer()` by using `names_to = "genus"` to create a new `genus`
variable for the exisiting column heading, and `values_to = "mean_weight"` to create
a variable `mean_weight` for the values. We put a minus sign before the 
variable `-plot_id` to tell the function not to use these values in the new variable column. 

(ref:pivl) `tidyr::pivot_longer`

```{r pivot-long, fig.cap='(ref:pivl)',fig.asp=1, out.width = '100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pivot_longer_R.png")
```


```{r wide-to-long}
surveys_spread %>% 
        pivot_longer(names_to = "genus", values_to = "mean_weight", -plot_id) 
```

### `tidyr::pivot_wider`

(ref:pivw) `tidyr::pivot_wider`

```{r surveys-gw, eval=FALSE}
surveys_gw <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab604/ab604.github.io/master/docs/surveys_grouped_weight.csv")
```


```{r pivot-wider, fig.cap='(ref:pivw)' ,fig.asp=1,out.width = '100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pivot_wider_R.png")
```


```{r long-to-wide}
surveys_gw %>% 
        pivot_wider(names_from = genus, values_from = mean_weight) 
```


```{r}
knitr::knit_exit()
```



## Missing values

As discussed in [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#missing-values-3) values can be missing in two ways:

+ **Explicitly**, i.e. flagged with NA.
+ **Implicitly**, i.e. simply not present in the data.

## Joining tables

Species
Portal_rodent_species contains the species codes used in Portal_rodent. Any animal found in a trap is recorded. Non-rodent species are occasionally trapped and so are given species codes. Several columns are also included in the species table to restrict the species list to only rodents, only target species, or only granivores.

Rodent adundance data
Portal_rodent contains the rodent trapping data. Each individual of a target species is PIT tagged and data on species, location caught (plot and stake), sex, reproductive condition, weight, and hindfoot length are recorded. In almost all cases, you will want to remove negative period codes before using this data. Negative period codes indicate data collected outside of the normal census protocols, and should absolutely not be used as regular trapping data.

```{r, cache=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
rodent_species <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weecology/PortalData/master/Rodents/Portal_rodent_species.csv")
# 
rodent_data <-  read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weecology/PortalData/master/Rodents/Portal_rodent.csv",
                         col_types = cols(tag = col_character(),
                                         prevrt = col_character(),
                                         ltag = col_character(),
                                         note2 = col_character(),
                                         note3 = col_character(), 
                                         note4 = col_character(), 
                                         note5 = col_character()))
```

```{r inner-join}
rodent_species %>% left_join(rodent_data, by = c("speciescode" = "species"))
```
