We've only scratched the surface of what is possible using R,
but what we've tried to cover in these materials are some
practical steps to approaching data analysis following
these ideas:

*"There are 5 core activities of data analysis:*

 1. *Stating and refining the question*
 2. *Exploring the data*
 3. *Building formal statistical models*
 4. *Interpreting the results*
 5. *Communicating the results"*

These are the epicycles of data analysis.

*"More specifically, for each of the five core activities, it is critical that you engage in the following steps:*

 1. *Setting Expectations,*
 2. *Collecting information (data), comparing the data to your expectations, and if the expectations donâ€™t match,*
 3. *Revising your expectations or fixing the data so your data and your expectations match."*

[Epicycle of Analysis, The Art of Data Science, Peng & Matsui](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/artofdatascience/epicycle-of-analysis.html)

In terms of these materials and R skills, this translates to:

1. Importing data.
2. Tidying and cleaning the data.
3. Transforming the data.
4. Plotting the data.
5. Exporting data and plots.

Those processes will enable you (indeed force you) to better state and refine
your questions, putting you into a good postion to consider
whether you need to revise your experimental/data collection
plan, and give you the foundation to go onto learning how to build statistical or other models R, or indeed in other languages. And to these things in reproducible ways.

## The R community

I mostly learn R through the online community, initially through the [Simply Statistics](https://simplystatistics.org/about/) 
blog which introduced me to R. Here's an entirely arbitrary collection of community people and links I discovered:
