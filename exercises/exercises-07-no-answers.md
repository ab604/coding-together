# Coding together week 7 - visualisations

## Warm-up
+ Complete the quiz
+ Recreate the `mpg` scatter plot from week 1

Plot the datasaurus with x and y and aesthetics and a point geometric object.
To plot each dataset on a different plot, add a facet layer with `facet_wrap(~ dataset)`
Here the `~` means faceting "depends upon the dataset variable"


## Geoms

Plot the mpg data as a line plot.
Plot it again with a smooth line. Hint the word smooth is important when choosing your geom. 

Add point and jitter to the by_quarter boxplot
