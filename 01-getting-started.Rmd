# Getting started {#getting-started}

If, when faced with the thought of starting to learning to code you feel like this:

(ref:imposter) [Imposter syndrome](https://bloggerbyresearch.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/a-baa-fail-cat-among-penguins.jpg).

```{r imposter, fig.cap='(ref:imposter)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("img/a-baa-fail-cat-among-penguins.jpg"))
```

Then hopefully by the end of these workshops, you'll feel a bit more like this:

(ref:r-cat) [R cat](https://stephensontam.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/lolcat-programmer.jpg)

```{r rcat, fig.cap='(ref:r-cat)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("img/lolcat-programmer.jpg"))
```

And if you like that, there is more at [R for cats](https://www.rforcats.net/).

## Philosohpy {#philosophy}

In terms of the philosophy of learning to code:

1. The primary motivation for using tools such as R is to get more done, in
less time and with less pain.

2. And the overall aim is to *understand and communicate* findings from our
data.

(ref:pipeline) Data project workflow.

```{r pipeline, fig.cap='(ref:pipeline)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data_project_pipeline.png")
```

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pipeline) of typical data analysis workflow,
to acheive this aim we need to learn tools that enable us to perform the 
fundamental tasks of tasks of importing, tidying and 
often transforming the data. Transformation means for example, selecting a 
subset of the data to work with, or calculating the mean of a set of observations.
We'll cover that in Chapter...

But first...

## What are R and RStudio? {#r-rstudio}

***"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses"***

*Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor C++*

**R** is a programming language that follows the philosophy laid down by it's
predecessor S. The philosophy being that users begin in an interactive
environment where they don't consciously think of themselves as programming. 
It was created in 1993, and documented in [@ihaka1996].

Reasons R has become popular include that it is both open source and cross platform,
and that it has broad functionality, from the analysis of data and creating 
powerful graphical visualisations and web apps.

Like all languages though it has limitations, for example the syntax is initially
confusing. 

Take for example the word `environment`...

### Environments

An environment is where we bring our data to work with it. Here we work in a R 
envrionment, using the R language as a set of tools.
**RStudio** is an integrated development environment, or IDE for R programming. 
It is regularly updated, and upgrading enables access to the latest features. 

The latest version can be downloaded here: http://www.rstudio.com/download

## Why learn R, or any language ?

There are many reasons one may wish to learn to code, and a common reason
is to automate tedious tasks so that one can spend more time on more interesting
ones.

We can write R code without saving it, but it's generally more useful to write 
and save our code as a script. Working with scripts makes the steps you used in 
your analysis clear, and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who 
can give  you feedback and spot mistakes.

Learning R (or any programming language) and working with scripts forces you to 
have deeper understanding of what you are doing, facilitates your learning 
and comprehension of the methods you use:

+ Writing and publishing code is important for reproducible resarch
+ R has many thousands of packages covering many disciplines.
+ R can work with many types of data.
+ They is a large R community for development and support.
+ Using R gives you control over your figures and reports.

## Finding your way around RStudio

Let's begin by learning about [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), the
Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

We will use R Studio IDE to write code, navigate the files found on our computer,
inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will
generate. R Studio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control,
developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that we don't have time to cover during
this workshop.

R Studio is divided into "Panes", see Figure \@ref(fig:rstudio).

When you first open it, there are three panes,the console where you type 
commands, your environment/history (top-right), and your
files/plots/packages/help/viewer (bottom-right).

The enivronment shows all the R objects you have created or are using, such
as data you have imported.

The output pane can be used to view any plots you have created.

Not opened at first start up is the fourth default pane: the script editor pane, 
but this will open as soon as we create/edit a R script (or many other document types). 
*The script editor is where will be typing much of the time.*

(ref:rstudio) The Rstudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

```{r rstudio,fig.cap='(ref:rstudio)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_ide_image.png")
```

The placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see menu, 
R Studio -> Tools -> Global Options -> Pane Layout). One of the advantages of 
using R Studio is that all the information you need to write code is available 
ina single window. Additionally, with many shortcuts, auto-completion, and 
highlighting for the major file types you use while developing in R, R Studio 
will make typing easier and less error-prone.

Time for another philosphical diversion...

### What is real?

At the start, we might consider our environment "real" - that is to say the objects
we've created/loaded and are using are "real". But it's much better in the long run
to consider our scripts as "real" - our scripts are where we write down the code
that creates our objects that we'll be using in our environment.

**As a script is a document, it is reproducible**

Or to put it another way: we can easily recreate an environment from our scripts, 
but not so easily create a script from an enivronment.

To support this notion of thinking in terms of our scripts as real, we recommend
turning off the preservation of workspaces between sessions by setting the 
Tools > Global Options menu in R studio as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:workspace):

(ref:turn-off) Don't save your workspace, save your script instead.

```{r workspace, fig.cap='(ref:turn-off)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rdata_turn_off.png")
```

## Where am I?

R studio tells you where you are in terms of directory address like so:

(ref:working-dir) Your working directory

```{r working-directory,fig.cap='(ref:working-dir)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_working_directory.png")
```

If you are unfamiliar with how computers structure folders and files, then 
consider a tree with a root from which the trunk extends and branches divide.
In the image above, the ~ symbol represents a contraction of the path from the
root to the 'home' directory (in Windows this is 'Documents') and then the 
forward slashes are the branches. (Note: Windows uses backslashes, Unix type 
systems and R use forwardslashes).

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
self-contained in a single folder, called the **working directory**. All of the
scripts within this folder can then use *relative paths* to files that indicate
where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to absolute paths, which
point to where a file is on a specific computer). Working this way makes it
a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and share it with
others without worrying about whether or not the underlying scripts will still
work.

(ref:dir-structure) A typical directory structure

```{r dir-structure,fig.cap='(ref:dir-structure)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/R-ecology-work_dir_structure.png")
```

## R projects

RStudio also has a facility to keep all files associated with a particular 
analysis together called a project.

Creating a project creates a working directory for you and also remembers
its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it) and optionally preserves
custom settings and open files to make it easier to resume work after a
break. 

(ref:r-project) Creating a R project

```{r r-projects,fig.cap='(ref:r-project)',fig.asp=1, out.width= '80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_create_project.PNG")
```

Below, we will go through the steps for creating an "R Project":

* Start R Studio (presentation of R Studio -below- should happen here)
* Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
  `Empty project`
* Enter a name for this new folder (or "directory", in computer science), and
  choose a convenient location for it. This will be your **working directory**
  for the rest of the day (e.g., `~/coding-together`)
* Click on "Create project"
* Under the `Files` tab on the right of the screen, click on `New Folder` and
  create a folder named `data` within your newly created working directory. (e.g., `~/data`)
* Create a new R script (File > New File > R script) and save it in your working
  directory (e.g. `01-coding-together-workshop-02-05-2019.R`)
  
## Using R projects with the `here` package  {#here}

Jenny Bryan loves the [`here`](https://here.r-lib.org/index.html) package by Kirill MÃ¼ller so much [she wrote an ode to it](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here).

In a nutshell, `here` sets the path implicitly to the top level of the R project
you are working in. **But what does that mean, and why should I care?**

What it means is that your code becomes reproducible on another machine where
the path to your project is different. For example...
  
## Naming things {#names}
  
[Jenny Bryan](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/12/08/rprofile-jenny-bryan/)
has three principles for [naming things](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf) that are well worth remembering.

When you names something, a file or an object, ideally it should be:
  
1. Machine readable (no whitespace, punctuation, upper AND lowercase...)
2. Human readable  (makes sense in 6 months or 2 years time)
3. Plays well with default ordering (numerical or date order)

## Seeking help

If you need help with a specific R function, let's say `barplot()`, you can type:

```{r barplot, eval=FALSE}
?barplot
```

A Google or internet search "R \<task\>" will often either send you to the appropriate package documentation or a helpful forum question that someone else already asked,
such as the [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r).

### Asking for help

As well as knowing [where to ask](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#where-to-ask), the key to get help 
from someone is for them to grasp your problem rapidly. You
should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the issue might be.

Try to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a 
package is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand 
what you meant, but others have really strong feelings about the difference
in meaning. The key point is that it can make things confusing for people 
trying to help you. Be as precise as possible when describing your problem.

If possible, try to reduce what doesn't work to a simple *reproducible
example* otherwise known as a *reprex*. 

For more information on how to write a reproducible example see 
[this article](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) using the `reprex` package.
