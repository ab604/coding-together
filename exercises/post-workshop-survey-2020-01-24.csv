It would have been quite useful. Sometime we were going quite quick through the exercises and if we had time before the session to try it, it would have been great. ","Id add optional 'homework' after the session to practise a bit more at home if people want to, and that would be a nice way to revise the previous all the previous codes at the beginning of each session ",Yes - with documentation,glimpse(),Yes - with documentation,filter(),Yes - with documentation,%>%,Yes - with documentation,mutate(),Yes - with documentation,make.csv()
