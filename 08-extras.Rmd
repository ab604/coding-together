## Pseudocode

[Pseudocode](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z3bq7ty/revision/2) is the idea
that we write down the steps of what we want to do in plain language 
to help us think about the actual code syntax we need to write.

For example, with the Portal surveys data we had a table with observations for
several plot types in, but we were only interested in the control and long-term kangaroo rat exclosure
plots.

So that step in pseudocode is: 

`I want make a table with only the observations 
for control and long-term kangaroo rat exclosure from the survey data.`

In steps:

1. Pipe the `surveys` table to the filter function.
2. Pass arguments to the filter function to filter for observations equal to the control plot type or 
observations equal to the long-term kangaroo rat exclosure plot type.

In R code this becomes:

```{r,eval}
surveys %>% 
        filter(plot_type == "Control" | 
        plot_type == "Long-term Krat Exclosure")
```

It can take a while and some research to figure out how to translate pseudocode
to R code, and there is often more than one way to acheive the same result, 
but the point of the pseudocode is that it forces us to be specific about what 
we want to do. You may even have to re-write the pseudocode several times or
talk to someone else to refine the question and then steps required to answer it.

The same approach can be used in many other areas of problem solving, such as
experimental design.

## Functions

Functions are objects, and comprise of three parts:

1. Name : short, but meaningful is advised
2. Arguments: the inputs to the function
3. Body: the code that does something with the arguments to create an output.

```{r function-structure, eval=FALSE}
<name> <- function(<arguments>){
        <body>
}
```


The body will generally use other functions, strung together to create our new 
function.

Let's illustrate this by creating a function to simulate rolling a pair of dice,
as per [Hands on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/basics.html#the-function-constructor)

```{r die, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/dice.jpg')
```

First we write some code that will become our function:

```{r die-parts}
# Assign the numbers to a die
die <- 1:6
# Sample the die numbers twice
dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
# Add them together
sum(dice)
```

Now we put those elements as the body of a function, and assign it to a function
called `roll` with no arguments:

```{r die-function}
# Roll two dice function
roll <- function(){
  die <- 1:6
  dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
  sum(dice)
}
```

What about doing this for a die of any number of sides? 

```{r dnd-dice, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/dnd_dice.JPG')
```

We remove the `die` object from the body of the function and turn it into an
argument that can take a sequence of integer values. Here we provide a default
of 1 to 6. It's good practice to supply a default argument.

```{r die2-function}
# Roll two dice of any size
roll_n <- function(die = 1:6) {
  dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
  sum(dice)
}
```

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/r-dice-function-07-10-2018.png')
```

## Working with Excel spreadsheets

### Gapminder

The [Gapminder Foundation](https://www.gapminder.org/):

> The mission of Gapminder Foundation is to fight devastating ignorance with a fact-based worldview that everyone can understand.

For example, the famously created a[a bubble chart of the life expectancy vs. income around the world](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles).

All sorts of data is available on their website and can be downloaded in various formats.
Here we have a set of data for income, and life expectancy in countries around the
world recorded between 1952 and 2007. (This version of gapminder data originated from [Tidyverse Booster, Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley/tidyverse-booster).)

```{r gapminder data, eval=FALSE}
# Download the gapminder data
download.file("https://github.com/ab604/ab604.github.io/raw/master/docs/gapminder.zip",
              destfile = "gapminder.zip")

# Unzip the the gapminder data
unzip("gapminder.zip")
```

There should now be a `gapminder` directory in your working directory containing
a folder of csv files and excel files. These contain the same data, but split in 
various ways: by country, by year or by continent.

We're going to work with the excel data, where the data is split across multiple
sheets in the same file.

### `readxl` package

We'll be using tidyverse package `readxl` for importing the excel data.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
df <- read_excel("<name and extension of your file>")
```

In other words, the default is to read the first sheet(tab) in the specified workbook. If your workbook is a little more complicated than this, you can crack it open and list the sheet names with the following excel_sheets function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
excel_sheets("<name and extension of your file>")
```

For example, lets look at the sheets in `gapminder-country.xlsx` :

```{r}
excel_sheets("gapminder/excel/gapminder-country.xlsx")
```

References to sheet names are direct and therefore do require quotes:

```{r eval=FALSE}
read_excel("<name and extension of your file>",
           sheet="Sheet 3")
```

For example let's load just the United Kingdom sheet and assign it to `uk_dat`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
uk_dat <- read_excel("gapminder/excel/gapminder-country.xlsx",
           sheet="United Kingdom")
```


Sheet indexing starts at 1, so alternatively, you could load in the third tab in with the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
read_excel("<name and extension of your file>",
           sheet=3)
```

In the read_excel function, if the `col_names` argument is left to its default value of `TRUE`, you will import the first line of the worksheet as the header names. In line with tibble and tidyverse standards, the readxl column header names are formed exactly as they were written in Excel.

Alternatively, if you wish to skip using header specified column-names and instead “number columns sequentially from `X1` to `XN`”, then set this argument to false: i.e. `col_names = FALSE`

For example, if you want to set a three column excel sheet to contain the data as dates in the first column, characters in the second, and numeric values in the third, you would need the following lines of code:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
read_excel("<name and extension of your file>",
           col_types = c("date", "numeric", "text"))
```


For the final of the most useful additional arguments available in read_excel, if you wish to skip rows before setting column names, there is the skip argument. This works exceptionally well for dealing with those intricately crafted database reports you enjoy so much.

Let’s say, for example, those daily reports you receive with a lovely logo, five rows of report generation details, and the column headers in the sixth row. Getting this imported quickly and tidily into R requires only the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read_excel("<name and extension of your file>",
           skip = 5)
```
           

## Map functions

Let's think about how we might read a number of excel sheets into a single
data frame. We met [map functions](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html) in Chapter \@ref(data-wrangle-2).

Map functions allow us to iterate an operation:

> The map functions transform their input by applying a function to each element and returning a vector the same length as the input.

There are lots of examples of using them in [R4DS map functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#the-map-functions).

Let's state the problem in pseudocode terms. The gapminder year spreadsheet contains
a sheet for every year between 1952 and 2007 recording life expectancy, population,
country and continent:

> We'd like to read all the sheets of the gapminder year spreadsheet into a single
table that adds a column to indicate the year of the observations.

In steps:

1. Create an object with the path to the spreadsheet
2. Create an object with the names of the individual sheetss in the spreadsheet
3. Read every sheet into a single data frame, creating a year variable from the sheet name

```{r map-excel-year, eval=FALSE}
# Get the path to the gapminder year spreadsheet
path <- "gapminder/excel/gapminder-year.xlsx"
# Create a named character vector using the sheet names
sheets <- set_names(excel_sheets(path))

# Check code for the first sheet
read_excel(path, sheet = sheets[[1]])

# Now map all sheets to a single data frame and create a year variable from 
# the sheet name
map_dfr(sheets, ~ read_excel(path, sheet = .x), .id = "year")
```

Now try the same approach to create the gapminder data using the `gapminder/excel/gapminder-country.xlsx`
spreadsheet combining all the invidual country sheets into a single table: 

```{r map-excel-country, eval=FALSE}
# replicate for excel/gapminder-country.xlsx to create gapminder data
path <- "gapminder/excel/gapminder-country.xlsx"
# Create a named character vector using the sheet names
sheets <- set_names(excel_sheets(path))

# Check code for first sheet
read_excel(path, sheet = sheets[[1]])
# Now map all sheets to a single data frame and create a country variable from 
# the sheet name
gapminder <- map_dfr(sheets, ~ read_excel(path, sheet = .x), .id = "country")
```

Let's look at the gapminder data

```{r gapminder-glimpse}
glimpse(gapminder)
```

Let's make a function to caluclate the GDP, representing the total 
income for each country and year where: `GDP = pop * gdpPercap` 

```{r gapminder-function, eval=FALSE}
# Takes a dataset and multiplies the population column
# with the GDP per capita column.
calcGDP <- function(dat, yr=NULL, ctry=NULL) {
  # Is there a year argument?
  if(!is.null(yr)) {
   dat <- dat %>% filter(year == yr)
  }
  # Is there a country argument?
  if (!is.null(ctry)) {
   dat <- dat %>% filter(country == ctry)
  }
  # Create new GDP column
  new <- dat %>% mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
  return(new)
}
```

Let's use our function to calculate the GDP for every country and every year:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
calcGDP(gapminder)
```


### Lollipop plot function

```{r}
plot_lollipop <-
        function(dat = gapminder,
                 cnt = "Europe",
                 yr = 1997) {
                dat %>%
                        mutate(cpop = fct_reorder(country, pop)) %>%
                        filter(continent == cnt & year == yr) %>%
                        ggplot(aes(x = cpop, y = pop)) +
                        geom_point() +
                        geom_segment(aes(
                                xend = cpop,
                                y = 0,
                                yend = pop
                        )) +
                        coord_flip() +
                        labs(x = "Population",
                             y = "Country") +
                        theme(legend.position = "")
        }

plot_lollipop()
```

Just to illustrate how this can be extended further using a loop to iterate.
See [R4DS for loops](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#for-loops).

```{r}
# Create a vector of continent names
con_names <- gapminder %>% select(continent) %>% distinct() %>% pull() 

# Plot all the continent lollipop plots for 1997 using a for loop
for (i in 1:length(con_names)) {
        print(plot_lollipop(gapminder,con_names[i], 1997))
} 
```


### Create three gapminder plots

```{r}
# Asia 1952 lollipop
asia_lollipop <- plot_lollipop(gapminder, "Asia", 1952)

# Life expectancy boxplot
lifexp_box <- gapminder %>% ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(continent,lifeExp), y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
        labs(x = "Continent", y = "Life expectancy")

# Life expectancy bubble plot for 2007
lifexp_bubble <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap,y = lifeExp, colour = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_minimal() +
        labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy")
```

## Combining plots with patchwork

See the [patchwork website](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) for lots more
guidance. The basic syntax is `+` to add a plot. 

```{r}
asia_lollipop + lifexp_box
```

Use brackets `()` to group plots and forwardslash `/` to create a new row:

```{r gapminder-patchwork}
lifexp_bubble / 
        (asia_lollipop + lifexp_box)
```

And `plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A")` with tag labels to add plot labels.

```{r gapminder-patchwork-with-labels}
lifexp_bubble / (asia_lollipop | lifexp_box) + 
        plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A")
```
