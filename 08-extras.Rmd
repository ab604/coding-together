## Pseudocode

[Pseudocode](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z3bq7ty/revision/2) is the idea
that we write down the steps of what we want to do in plain language 
to help us think about the actual code syntax we need to write.

For example, with the Portal surveys data we had a table with observations for
several plot types in, but we were only interested in the control and long-term kangaroo rat exclosure
plots.

So that step in pseudocode is: 

`I want make a table with only the observations 
for control and long-term kangaroo rat exclosure from the survey data.`

In steps:

1. Pipe the `surveys` table to the filter function.
2. Pass arguments to the filter function to filter for observations equal to the control plot type or 
observations equal to the long-term kangaroo rat exclosure plot type.

In R code this becomes:

```{r,eval}
surveys %>% 
        filter(plot_type == "Control" | 
        plot_type == "Long-term Krat Exclosure")
```

It can take a while and some research to figure out how to translate pseudocode
to R code, and there is often more than one way to acheive the same result, 
but the point of the pseudocode is that it forces us to be specific about what 
we want to do. You may even have to re-write the pseudocode several times or
talk to someone else to refine the question and then steps required to answer it.

The same approach can be used in many other areas of problem solving, such as
experimental design.

## Functions

Functions are objects, and comprise of three parts:

1. Name: short, but meaningful is advised
2. Arguments: the inputs to the function
3. Body: the code that does something with the arguments to create an output.

```{r function-structure, eval=FALSE}
<name> <- function(<arguments>){
        <body>
}
```


The body will generally use other functions, strung together to create our new 
function.

Let's illustrate this by creating a function to simulate rolling a pair of dice,
as per [Hands on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/basics.html#the-function-constructor)

```{r die, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/dice.jpg')
```

First we write some code that will become our function:

```{r die-parts}
# Assign the numbers to a die
die <- 1:6
# Sample the die numbers twice
dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
# Add them together
sum(dice)
```

Now we put those elements as the body of a function, and assign it to a function
called `roll` with no arguments:

```{r die-function}
# Roll two dice function
roll <- function(){
  die <- 1:6
  dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
  sum(dice)
}
```

What about doing this for a die of any number of sides? 

```{r dnd-dice, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/dnd_dice.JPG')
```

We remove the `die` object from the body of the function and turn it into an
argument that can take a sequence of integer values. Here we provide a default
of 1 to 6. It's good practice to supply a default argument.

```{r die2-function}
# Roll two dice of any size
roll_n <- function(die = 1:6) {
  dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
  sum(dice)
}
```

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/r-dice-function-07-10-2018.png')
```

## Working with Excel spreadsheets

### Gapminder

The [Gapminder Foundation](https://www.gapminder.org/):

> The mission of Gapminder Foundation is to fight devastating ignorance with a fact-based worldview that everyone can understand.

For example, the famously created [a bubble chart of the life expectancy vs. income around the world](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles).

All sorts of data is available on their website and can be downloaded in various formats.
Here we have a set of data for income, and life expectancy in countries around the
world recorded between 1952 and 2007. (This version of gapminder data originated from [Tidyverse Booster, Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley/tidyverse-booster).)

```{r gapminder data, eval=FALSE}
# Download the gapminder data
download.file("https://github.com/ab604/ab604.github.io/raw/master/docs/gapminder.zip",
              destfile = "gapminder.zip")

# Unzip the the gapminder data
unzip("gapminder.zip")
```

There should now be a `gapminder` directory in your working directory containing
a folder of csv files and excel files. These contain the same data, but split in 
various ways: by country, by year or by continent.

We're going to work with the excel data, where the data is split across multiple
sheets in the same file.

### `readxl` package

We'll be using tidyverse package `readxl` for importing the excel data. Some of
the notes below are based on a tutorial by [Karlijn Willems](https://twitter.com/willems_karlijn)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
```

The basic syntax is similar to `read_csv` or `read_tsv` from the `readr` package
where you pass the file path and name as a character vector to the `read_excel` function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
df <- read_excel("<name and extension of your file>")
```

The default is to read the first sheet in the workbook. If your workbook has
multiple sheets you can open and list the sheet names with the  `excel_sheets` function.
Individual sheets must be read as individual tables.

```{r eval=FALSE}
excel_sheets("<name and extension of your file>")
```

For example, lets look at the sheets in `gapminder-country.xlsx` :

```{r}
excel_sheets("gapminder/excel/gapminder-country.xlsx")
```

And then load the United Kingdom sheet and assign it to `uk_dat`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
uk_dat <- read_excel("gapminder/excel/gapminder-country.xlsx",
           sheet="United Kingdom")
```

References to sheet names are character vectors and therefore do require quotes.

Sheet indexing starts at 1, so alternatively, you could load in the 134th sheet for the UK with the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
read_excel("gapminder/excel/gapminder-country.xlsx",
           sheet=134)
```

In the read_excel function, if the `col_names` argument is left to its default value of `TRUE`, you will import the first line of the worksheet as the header names.

Alternatively, if you wish to skip using header specified column-names and instead “number columns sequentially from `...1` to `...N`”, then set this argument to false: i.e. `col_names = FALSE`

Likewise you can override the default data types assigned by `read_excel` using
the `col_types` argument.
For example, if you wanted to set a three column excel sheet to contain the data 
as dates in the first column, characters in the second, and numeric values in the third, 
you would need the following lines of code:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
read_excel("<name and extension of your file>",
           col_types = c("date", "numeric", "text"))
```


For the final of the most useful additional arguments available in read_excel, 
if you wish to skip rows before setting column names, there is the `skip` argument. 

For example, if the spreadsheet had blank rows or other information in the first
five rows, and the column headers in the sixth row, using `skip = 5` will read
the spreadsheet correctly.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read_excel("<name and extension of your file>",
           skip = 5)
```
           

## Map functions

Let's think about how we might read a number of excel sheets into a single
data frame. We met [map functions](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html) in Chapter \@ref(data-wrangle-2).

Map functions allow us to iterate an operation:

> The map functions transform their input by applying a function to each element and returning a vector the same length as the input.

There are lots of examples of using them in [R4DS map functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#the-map-functions).

Let's state the problem in pseudocode terms. The gapminder year spreadsheet contains
a sheet for every year between 1952 and 2007 recording life expectancy, population,
country and continent:

> We'd like to read all the sheets of the gapminder year spreadsheet into a single
table that adds a column to indicate the year of the observations.

In steps:

1. Create an object with the path to the spreadsheet
2. Create an object with the names of the individual sheetss in the spreadsheet
3. Read every sheet into a single data frame, creating a year variable from the sheet name

```{r map-excel-year, eval=FALSE}
# Get the path to the gapminder year spreadsheet
path <- "gapminder/excel/gapminder-year.xlsx"
# Create a named character vector using the sheet names
sheets <- set_names(excel_sheets(path))

# Check code for the first sheet
read_excel(path, sheet = sheets[[1]])

# Now map all sheets to a single data frame and create a year variable from 
# the sheet name
map_dfr(sheets, ~ read_excel(path, sheet = .x), .id = "year")
```

Now try the same approach to create the gapminder data using the `gapminder/excel/gapminder-country.xlsx`
spreadsheet combining all the invidual country sheets into a single table: 

```{r map-excel-country, eval=FALSE}
# replicate for excel/gapminder-country.xlsx to create gapminder data
path <- "gapminder/excel/gapminder-country.xlsx"
# Create a named character vector using the sheet names
sheets <- set_names(excel_sheets(path))

# Check code for first sheet
read_excel(path, sheet = sheets[[1]])
# Now map all sheets to a single data frame and create a country variable from 
# the sheet name
gapminder <- map_dfr(sheets, ~ read_excel(path, sheet = .x), .id = "country")
```

Here the map function takes each value in `sheets` as passes it as `.x` to the
sheet argument of `read_excel` and also it as the value for a new variable `country`
created by the `.id` argument so that each observation in the new combined table
corresponds with the country sheet from which it derived.

Let's look at the gapminder table we created for all the countries.

```{r gapminder-glimpse}
glimpse(gapminder)
```

### Lollipop plot function

Imagine we wanted to create a plot showing the population in each country,
for any continent, for any of the years when the gapminder survey was carried out.
Rather writing the code for each plot every time, we could write a function where
we can pass the continent and year as arguments.

In the code below we create a lollipop plot, which is a sort of barplot, using 
two geoms, point and segment. 

Step wise the body of the function does the following:

1. Mutate the data to create a new `cpop` factor variable of each country ordered
according to the population variable.
2. The data is then filtered for observations corresponding to the continent and year arguments.
3. Call `ggplot` with aesthetics `x = cpop` and `y = pop`.
4. Add a point geom.
5. Add a segment for the lollipop stick going from each `cpop` on the x-axis, starting
at 0 on the y-axis to the the `pop` value.
6. Turn the plot 90 degrees
7. Change the axis labels
8. Hide the legend

```{r}
plot_lollipop <-
        function(dat = gapminder,
                 cnt = "Europe",
                 yr = 1997) {
                dat %>%
                        mutate(cpop = fct_reorder(country, pop)) %>%
                        filter(continent == cnt & year == yr) %>%
                        ggplot(aes(x = cpop, y = pop)) +
                        geom_point() +
                        geom_segment(aes(
                                xend = cpop,
                                y = 0,
                                yend = pop
                        )) +
                        coord_flip() +
                        labs(x = "Population",
                             y = "Country") +
                        theme(legend.position = "")
        }

# Use the function with default arguments
plot_lollipop()
```

Just to illustrate how this can be extended further using a map function again 
to iterate through each continent. See [R4DS on iteration](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html).

This shows how functions can automate a task with a little bit of upfront effort.
Here we pass each value of `con_names` to our `plot_lollipop` function `cnt` argument
as `.x` in the same way we did for `sheet =` in when using `map_dfr` with `read_excel`.

```{r map-lollipop-plot}
# Create a vector of continent names
con_names <- gapminder %>% select(continent) %>% distinct() %>% pull() 

# Plot using map function as before
map(con_names, ~ plot_lollipop(gapminder, .x, 1997))
```

## Combining plots with patchwork

See the [patchwork website](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) for lots more
guidance.

### Create four gapminder plots

Let's create four plots from the gapminder data:

1. A bubble plot for life expectancy vs. gdp per capita in 1952
2  A bubble plot for life expectancy vs. gdp per capita in 2007
3. A life expectancy boxplot for each continent in 1952
4. A life expectancy boxplot for each continent in 2007

```{r}
# Life expectancy bubble plot for 2007
bubble_1952 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 1952) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap,y = lifeExp, colour = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_minimal() +
        labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy") +
                        theme(legend.position = "") +
  ggtitle("1952")
  

# Life expectancy bubble plot for 2007
bubble_2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap,y = lifeExp, colour = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_minimal() +
        labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy") +
                        theme(legend.position = "") +
  ggtitle("2007")

# Life expectancy boxplot for 1952
box_1952 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1952) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(continent,lifeExp), 
             y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
        labs(x = "Continent", y = "Life expectancy") +
  ggtitle("1952")

# Life expectancy boxplot for 2007
box_2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(continent,lifeExp), 
             y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
        labs(x = "Continent", y = "Life expectancy") +
  ggtitle("2007")
```

The basic syntax is `+` to add a plot. Let's plot the two boxplots.

```{r patch-1}
box_1952 + box_2007
```

Use brackets `()` to group plots and forwardslash `/` to create a new row.
Now plot the bubble plots, each one on its own row, and group the boxplots onto
a single row:

```{r gapminder-patchwork}
bubble_1952 / bubble_2007 / 
        (box_1952 + box_2007)
```

And `plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A")` with tag labels to add plot labels.

```{r gapminder-patchwork-with-labels}
bubble_1952 / bubble_2007 / 
        (box_1952 + box_2007) + 
        plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A")
```
