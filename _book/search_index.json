Code of conduct", " Coding togetheR Alistair Bailey October 17 2019 Welcome A Carrick bend: The Carrick bend is a type of sailor’s knot used for joining two lines. Coding togetheR is a series of collaborative workshops to teach foundational R coding and data science skills at the University of Southampton in 2019. This book contains the materials covered over eight, two hour sessions. The workshops are for anyone at the University of Southampton with data to analyse and who is struggling with their current tools. This series of eight weekly two hour workshops provides an introduction to working with data using R in a supported environment. Unlike traditional lessons, we all code together with the emphasis on participants learning by doing and by helping each other. These materials are a mash-up of my own and many others. I’ve endeavoured to credit everyone appropriately, but please message me if I’ve messed up and I’ll correct it. The main sources used here are: R for data science (R4DS), the R4DS community, the Carpentries, Hands on Programming in R, swiRlstats and Teaching Tech togetheR. It was written using R (R Core Team 2019) in RStudio (RStudio Team 2018) using the bookdown package (Xie 2019). To follow these materials you will need an up to date version of R (R Core Team 2019) and RStudio (RStudio Team 2018). This may require requesting permission to install software from Isolutions if you have a University laptop. R and RStudio If you are new to R, then the first thing to know is that R is a programming language and RStudio is a program for working with R called an integrated development environment (IDE). You can use R without RStudio, but not the other way around. Further details in Chapter 1. Download R here and Download RStudio Desktop here. These materials were generated using R version 3.6. Once you’ve installed R and RStudio, you’ll also need a few R packages. Packages are collections of functions. Open RStudio and put the code below into the Console window and press Enter to install the tidyverse,dslabs,janitor and here packages. install.packages(c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;,&quot;dslabs&quot;,&quot;janitor&quot;,&quot;here&quot;)) Who is coding togetheR for? Following the lesson design process of (Wilson 2018): Arshad As a PhD student in ecology Arshad doesn’t have any formal coding training, but is gathering field data about bird populations. He is daunted by the prospect of learning to code. These lessons will introduce Arshad to coding by showing him how to organise and automate analysis of his data. Jenny As a post doctoral researcher in gerontology Jenny has experience of research, but is unsatisfied with her current spreadsheet tools for analysing data. These lessons will show her how to write code to analyse spreadsheets. Lin As a principal investigator Lin has experience using MATLAB, but has not used R and would like to know more about it. These lessons will introduce Lin to R syntax and RStudio workflows. Code of conduct Coding togetheR is for everyone, and in order to make it a supportive and inclusive environment we subscribe to the Carpentries Code of Conduct. Please follow the link for details. In a nutshell, expected behaviour is as follows: Use welcoming and inclusive language Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences Gracefully accept constructive criticism Focus on what is best for the community Show courtesy and respect towards other community members Participants who violate the code of conduct, will be asked to stop immediately and if necessary asked to leave the workshop and incidents reported as per University guidance on inappropriate behaviour.

Figure 1.1: Imposter syndrome. Then hopefully by the end of these materials, you’ll feel a bit more like the cat in Figure 1.2. Figure 1.2: R cat And if you like that, there is more at R for cats. 1.2 A little background and philosophy “There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses” Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor C++ 1.2.1 What is R? R is a programming language that follows the philosophy laid down by it’s predecessor S. The philosophy being that users begin in an interactive environment where they don’t consciously think of themselves as programming. It was created in 1993, and documented in (Ihaka and Gentleman 1996). Reasons R has become popular include that it is both open source and cross platform, and that it has broad functionality, from the analysis of data and creating powerful graphical visualisations and web apps. Like all languages though it has limitations, for example the syntax is initially confusing. Users and developers of R have in recent years sought to develop an inclusive and welcoming community which can found on twitter #rstats or through RStudio Community. There are many useR groups, including groups seeking to promote diversity such as R-Ladies: Jumping Rivers maintains a list. 1.2.2 Why learn to code at all? In terms of the philosophy of learning to code: The primary motivation for using tools such as R is to get more done, in less time and with less pain. And the overall aim is to understand and communicate findings from our data. Additionally, as per Greg Wilson’s description of his motivation for teaching, if we’re going to help make the world a better place, a bit of coding is likely to be key tool in your kit. Figure 1.3: Data project workflow. As shown in Figure 1.3 of typical data analysis workflow, to achieve this aim we need to learn tools that enable us to perform the fundamental tasks of tasks of importing, tidying and often transforming the data. Transformation means for example, selecting a subset of the data to work with, or calculating the mean of a set of observations. 1.2.3 A little goes a long way Returning to our cat friend in Figure 1.2, one doesn’t need to be an expert programmer to find coding useful. As illustrated in Figure 1.4 there is a whole spectrum of code users from practitioners who are focused on applying some R to their specific problems, to those programmers who develop the R language itself. In reality one may move around on that spectrum as ones interests change over time. Figure 1.4: The Practitioner-Programmer spectrum 1.3 RStudio Let’s begin by learning about RStudio, the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). R is the language and RStudio is software created to facilitate our use of R. They are installed separately. You don’t need RStudio to use R, but you do need R to used RStudio. We will use R Studio IDE to write code, navigate the files found on our computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will generate. R Studio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that we don’t have time to cover during this workshop. R Studio is divided into “Panes”, see Figure 1.5. When you first open it, there are three panes,the console where you type commands, your environment/history (top-right), and your files/plots/packages/help/viewer (bottom-right). The environment shows all the R objects you have created or are using, such as data you have imported. The output pane can be used to view any plots you have created. Not opened at first start up is the fourth default pane: the script editor pane, but this will open as soon as we create/edit a R script (or many other document types). The script editor is where will be typing much of the time. Figure 1.5: The RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see menu, R Studio -&gt; Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Pane Layout). One of the advantages of using R Studio is that all the information you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, with many short-cuts, auto-completion, and highlighting for the major file types you use while developing in R, R Studio will make typing easier and less error-prone. RStudio has lots of keyboard short-cuts to make coding quicker and easier. Try to find the menu listing all the keyboard short-cuts, including the short-cut to find the menu! Time for another philosophical diversion… 1.3.1 What is real? At the start, we might consider our environment “real” - that is to say the objects we’ve created/loaded and are using are “real”. But it’s much better in the long run to consider our scripts as “real” - our scripts are where we write down the code that creates our objects that we’ll be using in our environment. As a script is a document, it is reproducible Or to put it another way: we can easily recreate an environment from our scripts, but not so easily create a script from an environment. To support this notion of thinking in terms of our scripts as real, we recommend turning off the preservation of workspaces between sessions by setting the Tools &gt; Global Options menu in R studio as shown in Figure 1.6. Figure 1.6: Don’t save your workspace, save your script instead. 1.3.2 Where am I? R studio tells you where you are in terms of directory address as shown in Figure 1.7. Figure 1.7: Your working directory If you are unfamiliar with how computers structure folders and files, then consider a tree with a root from which the trunk extends and branches divide. In the image above, the ~ symbol represents a contraction of the path from the root to the ‘home’ directory (in Windows this is ‘Documents’) and then the forward slashes are the branches. (Note: Windows uses backslashes, Unix type systems and R use forward slashes). It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text self-contained in a single folder, called your working directory. All of the scripts within this folder can then use relative paths to files that indicate where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to absolute paths, which point to where a file is on a specific computer). An example directory structure is illustrated in Figure 1.8. Working this way makes it a lot easier to move your project around on your computer. Section 1.4 builds upon this to create a robust workflow for data analysis. Figure 1.8: A typical directory structure 1.3.3 Getting help If you need help with a specific R function, let’s say barplot(), you can type: ?barplot A Google or internet search “R &lt;task&gt;” will often either send you to the appropriate package documentation or a helpful forum question that someone else already asked, such as the RStudio Community or Stack Overflow. As well as knowing where to ask, the key to get help from someone is for them to grasp your problem rapidly. You should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the issue might be. Try to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a package is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand what you meant, but others have really strong feelings about the difference in meaning. The key point is that it can make things confusing for people trying to help you. Be as precise as possible when describing your problem. If possible, try to reduce what doesn’t work to a simple reproducible example otherwise known as a reprex. For more information on how to write a reproducible example see this article using the reprex package. 1.3.4 Installing and loading packages Packages are collections of functions, and a function is a piece of code written to perform a specific task, such as installing a package. Therefore, the function install.packages() is a piece of code written to perform the task of installing packages. We use it by typing install.packages(\"tidyverse\") with the name of the package in quotes inside the round brackets. Here the package is tidyverse. Using the console panel to type this and pressing Enter will run the function. We of course need to know the name of the packages we are interested in. Once a package is installed we need to load it into our environment to use it. Loading packages is performed using the library() function. As with installation, we put the name of the package we want to load in between the round brackets like so library(tidyverse). As before this can be done on the console, but we will usually load packages as part of script. Note that we don’t need the quotes for the library function. Try installing the cowsay package and loading it. It has one function called say() that you can use to create messages with animals. 1.3.5 Using functions As stated in 1.3.4 a function is a piece of code written to perform a specific task. Functions in R have the syntax of the name of the function followed by round brackets. The round brackets are where we type the arguments that the function requires to carry out its task. For example, in 1.3.4 the function install.packages() requires the name of the package we want to install as arguments. Many, if not most, functions can take more than one argument. The creators of the function should have given these defaults for the situation where the user provides only one or some arguments. RStudio should prompt you for the arguments as you type, but if you need to see what they are, use the help function ? with the function name in the Console and it will open the help panel or type the function name into the help panel search box. For example, to find out all the arguments for install.packages() we’d type ?install.packages and press Enter. Try using say() to say “I are programmer” in the cowsay package and then find out what the arguments you can provide to make it produce different types of message. 1.4 A project orientated workflow This section is all about how to use R and RStudio to “maximize effectiveness and reduce frustration.” The above quote is from Jenny Bryan’s article about a project orientated workflow. The main point here is that how you do things, the workflow, should not be mixed up with the product of the workflow itself. The product being: the raw data. the code needed to produce the results from the raw data. Ways in which you can mix workflow and product include having lines in your script that set your working directory, or using RStudio to save your environment when you are working. But why is this a problem? It’s because your computer isn’t my computer or my laptop isn’t my desktop or I’m now using a Windows machine and I wrote the code two years ago on a Mac. By hard coding the directory into a script I have ensured my code will only run on the machine in which it was written. Chances are you will want to share your code with someone, either for publication or for them to check your work, or because you are working collaboratively and therefore we need to avoid mixing workflow with product. Likewise we can’t share environments directly, but we can share the code that creates the environment. If we organise our analysis into self-contained projects that hold everything needed to perform the analysis. These projects can be shared across machines and the analysis recreated, and thus the workflow is kept separate from the product. What does this look like in practice? 1.4.1 RStudio Projects Step one is to use an interactive development environment such as RStudio rather than using R on its own for your analysis. RStudio contains a facility to keep all files associated with a particular analysis together called, as you might expect from 1.4, a Project. Creating a Project creates a file .Rproj containing all the information associated with your analysis including the Project location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it), and optionally preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to resume work after a break. This is also super helpful if you are working on multiple projects as you can switch between them at a click. Figure 1.9: Creating a R project Below, we will go through the steps for creating an Project: Start R Studio (presentation of R Studio -below- should happen here) Under the File menu, click on New project, choose New directory, then Empty project Enter a name for this new folder (or “directory”, in computer science), and choose a convenient location for it. This will be your working directory for the rest of the day (e.g., ~/coding-together) Click on “Create project” Under the Files tab on the right of the screen, click on New Folder and create a folder named data within your newly created working directory. (e.g., ~/data) Create a R notebook (File &gt; New File &gt; R notebook) and save it in your working directory (e.g. 01-coding-together-workshop-02-05-2019.Rmd) Or create a new R script (File &gt; New File &gt; R script) and save it in your working directory (e.g. 01-coding-together-workshop-02-05-2019.R) 1.4.2 R notebooks and R scripts R notebooks combine writing text with R code in chunks. The R code chunks are indicated by three backticks and a lowercase r in brackets: ```{r} ```. Text can be formatted using markdown syntax. These are great for doing analysis and report wrting at the same time. R scripts are text files containing the commands that you would enter into the R console. They are great for containing code you wish to call into another script such as code for a function, or if you are submitting a script as job to run on another computer without the need for RStudio. 1.4.3 Level up with the here package This is a bit more tricky, so you might like to come back to here later, but Jenny Bryan loves the here package by Kirill Müller so much she wrote an ode to it. In a nutshell, the here() function sets the path implicitly to the top level of the R project you are working in. But what does that mean, and why should I care? Using the here() function like this: library(here) here(\"data\", \"file_i_want.csv\") where \"data\" is the folder containing \"file_i_want.csv\", the function works out the rest of the path to the folder and file. This is useful if you open the project on different machines where the path is different. here() takes care of things, thus saving you some pain. 1.4.4 Naming things Jenny Bryan also has three principles for naming things that are well worth remembering. When you names something, a file or an object, ideally it should be: Machine readable (no white space, punctuation, upper AND lower-case…) Human readable (makes sense in 6 months or 2 years time) Plays well with default ordering (numerical or date order) We’ll see examples of this as we go along. 1.5 The tidyverse and tidy data The tidyverse (Wickham 2017) is “an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science” . Tidyverse packages contain functions that “share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.” It’s this philosophy that makes tidyverse functions and packages relatively easy to learn and use. Tidy data follows three principals for tabular data as proposed in the Tidy Data paper http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper : Every variable has its own column. Every observation has its own row. Each value has its own cell. We’ll be using the tidyverse and learning more about tidy data as we go along. 1.6 Atoms of R Having set ourselves up in RStudio, let’s turn our attention to the language of R itself. The basic building blocks of how R stores data are called atomic vector types. It’s from these atoms that more complex structures are built. Atomic vectors have one dimension, just like a single row or a single column in a spreadsheet. The four main atoms of R are: Doubles: regular numbers, +ve or -ve and with or without decimal places. AKA numerics. Integers: whole numbers, specified with an upper-case L, e.g. int &lt;- 2L Characters: Strings of text Logicals: these store TRUE‘s and FALSE’s’ which are useful for comparisons. Figure 1.10: The four most used atomic vectors, the building blocks of R Let’s make a character vector and check the atomic vector type, using the typeof(). This also introduces a very important R function c(). This lower case c stands for combine. So when we have several objects e.g. words or numbers, we can combine them into a vector the length of the number of objects, as illustrated here for a pack of cards: cards &lt;- c(&quot;ace&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, &quot;queen&quot;, &quot;jack&quot;, &quot;ten&quot;) cards ## [1] &quot;ace&quot; &quot;king&quot; &quot;queen&quot; &quot;jack&quot; &quot;ten&quot; typeof(cards) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Note here that we see the use of the assignment operator &lt;- to assign our vector on the right as the object cards. We talk more about that in 1.7. Try creating a vector of numbers from 1 to 10 using the seq() function. Remember to use ?seq if you want to learn more about the function. 1.7 Assigning objects Objects are just a way to store data inside the R environment. We assign labels to objects using the assignment operator &lt;- mass_kg &lt;- 55 Read this as “mass_kg is assigned to value 55” in your head. A subtle but important point here is that the object is 55 and the value remains 55 regardless of the label we assign to it. In fact we could assign more than one label to the same object. Another way to think about this is that Bibi is a cat, and remains a cat even if I call her Princess when she refuses to go out in the rain. Figure 1.11: Bibi remains a cat even if I call her Princess when she refuses to go out in the rain. Using &lt;- can be annoying to type, so use RStudio’s keyboard short cut: Alt + - (the minus sign) to make life easier. Many people ask why we use this assignment operator when we can use = instead? Colin Fay had a Twitter thread on this subject, but the reason I favour most is that it provides clarity. The arrow points in the direction of the assignment (it is actually possible to assign in the other direction too) and it distinguishes between creating an object in the workspace and assigning a value inside a function. Object name style is a matter of choice, but must start with a letter and can only contain letters, numbers, _ and .. We recommend using descriptive names and using _ between words. Some special symbols cannot be used in variable names, so watch out for those. So here we’ve used the name to indicate its value represents a mass in kilograms. Look in your environment pane and you’ll see the mass_kg object containing the (data) value 55. We can inspect an object by typing it’s name: mass_kg ## [1] 55 What’s wrong here? mass_KG Error: object 'mass_KG' not found This error illustrates that typos matter, everything must be precise and mass_KG is not the same as mass_kg. mass_KG doesn’t exist, hence the error. Let’s use seq() to create a sequence of numbers, and at the same time practice tab completion. Start typing se in the console and you should see a list of functions appear, add q to shorten the list, then use the up and down arrow to highlight the function of interest seq() and hit Tab to select. This is tab completion. RStudio puts the cursor between the parentheses to prompt us to enter some arguments. Here we’ll use 1 as the start and 10 as the end: seq(1,10) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 If we left off a parentheses to close the function, then when we hit enter we’ll see a + indicating RStudio is expecting further code. We either add the missing part or press Escape to cancel the code. Let’s call a function and make an assignment at the same time. Here we’ll use the base R function seq() which takes three arguments: from, to and by. Read the following code as \"assign my_sequence to an object that stores a sequence of numbers from 2 to 20 by intervals of 2. my_sequence &lt;- seq(2,20,2) This time nothing was returned to the console, but we now have an object called my_sequence in our environment. 1.7.1 Indexing and subsetting If we want to access and subset elements of my_sequence we use square brackets [] and the index number. Indexing in R starts at 1 such that 1 is the index of the first element in the sequence, element 1 having the the value of 2. For example element five would be subset by: my_sequence[5] ## [1] 10 Here the number five is the index of the vector, not the value of the fifth element. The value of the fifth element is 10. And returning multiple elements uses a colon :, like so my_sequence[5:8] ## [1] 10 12 14 16 1.8 Lists, matrices and arrays Lists also group data into one dimensional sets of data. The difference being that list group objects instead of individual values, such as several atomic vectors. For example, let’s make a list containing a vector of numbers and a character vector list_1 &lt;- list(1:110,&quot;R&quot;) list_1 ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ## [18] 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 ## [35] 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 ## [52] 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 ## [69] 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 ## [86] 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 ## [103] 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;R&quot; Note the double brackets to indicate the list elements, i.e. element one is the vector of numbers and element two is a vector of a single character. We won’t be working with lists a great deal in these workshops, but they are a flexible way to store data of different types in R. Accessing list elements uses double square brackets syntax, for example list_1[[1]] would return the first vector in our list. And to access the first element in the first vector would combine double and single square brackets like so: list_1[[1]][1]. Don’t worry if you find this confusing, everyone does when they first start with R. Hadley Wickham tweeted an image to illustrate list indexing shown in 1.12. Figure 1.12: List indexing by Hadley Wickham Lists alongside NULL which indicates the absence of a vector, complete the set of base vectors in R as illustrated in 1.13. Figure 1.13: The base vectors in R. 1.8.1 Matrices and arrays Matrices store values in a two dimensional array, whilst arrays can have n dimensions. We won’t be using these either, but they are also valid R objects. 1.9 Factors Factors are Rs way of storing categorical information such as eye colour or car type. A factor is something that can only have certain values, and can be ordered (such as low,medium,high) or unordered such as types of fruit. Factors are useful as they code string variables such as “red” or “blue” to integer values e.g. 1 and 2, which can be used in statistical models and when plotting, but they are confusing as they look like strings. Factors look like strings, but behave like integers. Historically R converts strings to factors when we load and create data, but it’s often not what we want as a default. Fortunately, in the tidyverse strings are not treated as factors by default. 1.10 Data frames For data analysis in R, we mostly be using data frames. Data frames are two dimensional versions of lists, and this is form of storing data we are going to be using. In a data frame each atomic vector type becomes a column, and a data frame is formed by columns of vectors of the same length. Each column element must be of the same type, but the column types can vary. Figure 1.14 shows an example data frame we’ll refer to as saved as the object df consisting of three rows and three columns. Each column is a different atomic data type of the same length. Figure 1.14: An example data frame df. To create the data frame 1.14 we can use the data.frame() function in conjunction with the c() function to make the individual atomic vectors that comprise the data frame as follows. Note that I am naming the vectors as I make the data frame after the type of vector e.g. numeric_vector = c(1,7,3). Also, as this is a base R function I need to tell the function not to treat the character strings as categorical data using stringsAsFactors = FALSE df &lt;- data.frame(numeric_vector = c(1,7,3), character_vector = c(&quot;S&quot;,&quot;A&quot;,&quot;U&quot;), logical_vector = c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) df ## numeric_vector character_vector logical_vector ## 1 1 S TRUE ## 2 7 A FALSE ## 3 3 U TRUE Packages in the tidyverse create a modified form of data frame called a tibble. You can read about tibbles here. One advantage of tibbles is that they don’t default to treating strings as factors. We deal with transforming data frames in chapters 2 and 3. Here’s what the code to make the same data frame as before as a tibble looks like. Note how we get more information from a tibble when it is returned to the Console, it tells us what the dimensions are, and what type of vectors it contains. df &lt;- tibble(numeric_vector = c(1,7,3), character_vector = c(&quot;S&quot;,&quot;A&quot;,&quot;U&quot;), logical_vector = c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)) df ## # A tibble: 3 x 3 ## numeric_vector character_vector logical_vector ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 1 S TRUE ## 2 7 A FALSE ## 3 3 U TRUE Sub-setting data frames can also be done with square bracket syntax, but as we have both rows and columns, we need to provide index values for both row and column. For example df[1,2] means return the value of df row 1, column 2. This corresponds with the value A. We can also use the colon operator to choose several rows or columns, and by leaving the row or column blank we return all rows or all columns. # Subset rows 1 and 2 of column 1 df[1:2,1] # Subset all rows of column 3 df[,3] Don’t worry too much about this for now, we won’t be doing to much of this in these lessons, but it’s worth being aware of this syntax. 1.10.1 Attributes An attribute is a piece of information you can attach to an object, such as names or dimensions. Attributes such as dimensions are added when we create an object, but others such as names can be added. Let’s look at the mpg data frame dimensions: # mpg has 234 rows (observations) and 11 columns (variables) dim(mpg) ## [1] 234 11 1.11 Plotting data One of the most useful and important parts of any data analysis is plotting data. We’ll be spending a whole lesson on it in chapter 6, but to give you an example, we’ll use the ggplot2 package as an introduction to automating a task in code, and as a tool for understanding data. ggplot2 implements the grammar of graphics, for describing and building graphs. The idea being that we construct a plot in the following way: Call the ggplot() function to create a graph. Pass our data as the first argue to the ggplot() function. Then pass some arguments to the aesthetics function aes() inside the gpplot() which tell ggplot how to plot the data e.g. which data goes on the x and y axis. Then we follow the ggplot function with a + sign to indicate we are going to add more code, followed by a geometric object function, a geom which maps the data to type of plot we want to make e.g. a histogram or scatter plot. Don’t worry if this sounds confusing, it becomes clear with practice and all plots follow this grammar. We’ll use the mpg dataset that comes with the tidyverse to examine the question do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines? Try ?mpg to learn more about the data. Engine size in litres is in the displ column. Fuel efficiency on the highway in miles per gallon is given in the hwy column. To create a plot of engine size displ (x-axis) against fuel efficiency hwy (y-axis) we do the following: Now try extending this code to include to add a colour aesthetic to the the aes() function, let colour = class, class being the vehicle type. This should create a plot with as before but with the points coloured according to the vehicle type to expand our understanding. ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class)) Now we can see that as we might expect, bigger cars such as SUVs tend to have bigger engines and are also less fuel efficient, but some smaller cars such as 2-seaters also have big engines and greater fuel efficiency. Hence we have a more nuanced view with this additional aesthetic. Check out the ggplot2 documentation for all the aesthetic possibilities (and Google for examples): http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ So now we have re-usable code snippet for generating plots in R: ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) + &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;(mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)) Concretely, in our first example &lt;DATA&gt; was mpg, the &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt; was geom_point() and the arguments we supplies to map our aesthetics &lt;MAPPINGS&gt; were x = displ, y = hwy. As we can use this code for any tidy data set, hopefully you are beginning to see how a small amount of code can do a lot. 1.12 Exporting data We’ll spend more time on getting data in and out of our R environment in the next chapter 3, but just to wrap this lesson up let’s imagine we wanted to export our plot and data for a colleague or presentation. 1.12.1 readr To export tibbles and data frames, we’ll use the readr package, and the write_excel_csv() function. This creates a table in comma separated variable format that can opened by spreadsheet software such as excel. As it is a function is has round brackets and the main arguments we pass are the object containing the data we want to output and the name of the file and the location we want to write the file to. write_excel_csv(df, &quot;outputs/example-data-02-05-2019.csv&quot;) Here we are writing the df data frame as a csv file to the outputs folder and a file called example-data-02-05-2019.csv. 1.12.2 ggsave If we want to save the last plot we made in ggplot2 we can use the ggsave() function We tell ggsave() the filename, and it will save it as that type depending on how we name the file. For example if we use file.pdf it will save a PDF and if we use file.jpeg it will save a jpeg. Check out ?ggsave or the line above for more options. To save our last plot for example: ggsave(&quot;outputs/example-plot-02-05-2019.pdf&quot;) 1.12.3 Exercise Create a new project called ‘coding-assessment-01’ Create two folders in this project: R and outputs Create a R script using best naming practices i.e. name-date.R In the script, write some comments at the top e.g. name, date, description Create a tibble comprising of a character vector, a numeric vector Install and load the dslabs package and create a density plot with ggplot2 using the heights dataset, using the x = height variable and fill = sex to create a density plot ggplot(data = heights, aes(x =height, fill = sex)) + geom_density() Save the plot as pdf and the tibble as csv file to the output folder.

It’s full of practical advice and context and well worth reading for helping you think about best practices for organising your data for yourself, and when working with others. 2.1.1 Flat formats and Excel files File formats like .csv and .tsv, comma separated variables and tab separated variables respectively are plain text files. That is to say they contain only the data, as text information, and are the simplest and most convenient way to share data as most software can read and interpret them. Excel files saves files into its own proprietary format .xls or .xlsx that holds information in addition to the data itself. For reading and writing excel files in R, the tidyverse readxl package is very useful. 2.2 The Portal Project data In this chapter we are going to focus on data from the Portal Project, which is a long running survey of rodents and other species in the Chihuahuan Desert, as analysed in the 1994 paper by Heske et. al: Long-Term Experimental Study of a Chihuahuan Desert Rodent Community: 13 Years of Competition, DOI: 10.2307/1939547. Specifically they explored the effect on the populations of small seed eating rodents as a result of the exclusion of larger competitor kangaroo rats over a period from 1977 to 1991. We’ll also use some of their data to explore this question: What is the effect of the exclusion of kangaroo rats from a plot of land on the granivore population? Figure 2.1 shows an image of one of the species of kangaroo rats excluded during the study. Figure 2.1: Merriam’s kangaroo rat, Dipodomys merriami Figure 2.2 indicates how the exclusion works, where a for number of fenced plots the kangaroo rats were either able to enter by a hole or kept out. Figure 2.2: Kangaroo Rat exclusion The plots are 50 metres by 50 metres, and a survey of the species within each plot has been ongoing once a month for many years. The dataset is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file. Each row holds information for a single animal, and the columns represent: Column Description Type record_id Unique id for the observation numeric month month of observation numeric day day of observation numeric year year of observation numeric plot_id ID of a particular plot numeric species_id 2-letter code character sex sex of animal (“M”, “F”) character hindfoot_length length of the hindfoot in mm numeric weight weight of the animal in grams numeric genus genus of animal character species species of animal character taxa e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit character plot_type type of plot character The rodents species surveyed are: Kangaroo Rats species_id Scientific name Common name DM Dipodomys merriami Merriam’s kangaroo rat DO Dipodomys ordii Ord’s kangaroo rat DS Dipodomys spectabilis Banner-tailed kangaroo rat Granivores species_id Scientific name Common name PP Chaetodipus penicillatus Desert pocket mouse PF Perognathus flavus Silky pocket mouse PE Peromyscus eremicus Cactus mouse PM Peromyscus maniculatus Deer Mouse RM Reithrodontomys megalotis Western harvest mouse 2.2.1 Downloading and importing the data First create a R project for this analysis e.g coding-together-week-2 The dataset is stored on-line, so we use the utility function download.file() to download the csv file to our data folder. (Did you create a data folder in the project directory?) Here we pass the url = and destfile = arguments to download.file(). As we have the tidyverse packages we can use the readr package it contains, which has many functions for reading files, including read_csv(). The advantage of read_csv() over base R read.csv() is that it defaults to reading strings as character vectors rather than factors (categorical variables) which is usually what we want. As we read the data into our environment we need to assign a label to the object we are creating. Here we assign the dataset to an object called surveys using the &lt;- assignment operator. # Download the data download.file(url=&quot;https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169&quot;, destfile = &quot;data/portal_data_joined.csv&quot;) # Read into R as an object called surveys surveys &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/portal_data_joined.csv&quot;) 2.3 dplyr dplyr “is a grammar of data manipulation”. Concretely, it’s a package of functions from the tidyverse that have been created for tasks that require manipulation of data stored in data frames. Figure 2.3: Why is it called dplyr? We’re going to use the most common verbs in dplyr to examine the Portal Project surveys data. 2.3.1 Filter rows with filter() The first verb to consider is the filter() function which enables us to subset observations based on their value. Consider the surveys data and sub-setting observations that only occurred from 1985 onwards. It’s fairly natural to say “filter the survey where the year variable is equal or greater than 1985”. And indeed this is how we use filter() as a verb. Figure 2.4 shows how we give the filter function two arguments. The first is the data frame, the second is the variable and condition on which we wish to filter. An alternative way to use filter() is to “pipe” the function using pipe %&gt;% from the magrittr package which you can think of as using the word “then”. We take our data set then filter it. Using the pipe makes more sense when combining several operations. Ctl+Shift+M is a keyboard short cut to create a pipe. For the filter itself, from R4DS: “To use filtering effectively, you have to know how to select the observations t hat you want using the comparison operators. R provides the standard suite: &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, != (not equal), and == (equal)….For other types of combinations, you’ll need to use Boolean operators yourself: &amp; is “and”, | is “or”, and ! is “not”.\" See Figure 5.1 in R4DS for to see how these operators work. (Note that we aren’t assigning the output to an object here, so we can see it.) Figure 2.4: dplyr::filter() # Filter observations that only occurred from 1985 onwards filter(surveys, year &gt;= 1985) ## # A tibble: 25,290 x 13 ## record_id month day year plot_id species_id sex hindfoot_length ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 10606 7 24 1985 2 NL F 30 ## 2 10617 7 24 1985 2 NL M 32 ## 3 10627 7 24 1985 2 NL F 32 ## 4 10720 8 20 1985 2 NL F 31 ## 5 10923 10 13 1985 2 NL F 31 ## 6 10949 10 13 1985 2 NL F 33 ## 7 11215 12 8 1985 2 NL F 32 ## 8 11329 3 9 1986 2 NL M 34 ## 9 11496 5 11 1986 2 NL F 31 ## 10 11498 5 11 1986 2 NL F 31 ## # ... with 25,280 more rows, and 5 more variables: weight &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # genus &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, taxa &lt;chr&gt;, plot_type &lt;chr&gt; An example using Boolean logic, would be to use the “or” operator | to filter for the observations only occurring on plot_type’s control or long term kangaroo rat exclusion. This time we assign the output to a new data frame called surveys_filtered. Note: as plot_type is a character vector we put the terms in quotes, and also the double equals sign == “for equal to”. # Keep only the rows corresponding with the Control and Long-term Krat Exclosure surveys_filtered &lt;- surveys %&gt;% filter(plot_type == &quot;Control&quot; | plot_type == &quot;Long-term Krat Exclosure&quot;) Note: filter() only includes rows where the condition is TRUE; it excludes both FALSE and missing NA values. We have to explicitly ask to keep NA values using is.na() as an additional filter. How did I know which plot_type’s to filter? I used the dplyr::distinct() function, passing the surveys data frame and the plot_type variable to obtain a list of the unique plot types, from which I determined the Control and Long-term Krat Exclosure plots were the ones I was after. Note that you need to add the argument .keep_all = TRUE to distinct() to return all the columns in the data frame distinct(surveys, plot_type) ## # A tibble: 5 x 1 ## plot_type ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Control ## 2 Long-term Krat Exclosure ## 3 Short-term Krat Exclosure ## 4 Rodent Exclosure ## 5 Spectab exclosure 2.3.2 Arrange rows with arrange() The next verb is arrange() which also operates on the rows, and enables you to arrange the observations in a data frame according to one or more variables. As with filter() we supply the variable or variables of interest as the arguments to arrange(). From R4DS: “If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns… Missing values are always sorted at the end.” Figure 2.5 shows how to arrange the observations according to the record_id variable. Figure 2.5: dplyr::arrange() surveys %&gt;% arrange(record_id) ## # A tibble: 34,786 x 13 ## record_id month day year plot_id species_id sex hindfoot_length ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 7 16 1977 2 NL M 32 ## 2 2 7 16 1977 3 NL M 33 ## 3 3 7 16 1977 2 DM F 37 ## 4 4 7 16 1977 7 DM M 36 ## 5 5 7 16 1977 3 DM M 35 ## 6 6 7 16 1977 1 PF M 14 ## 7 7 7 16 1977 2 PE F NA ## 8 8 7 16 1977 1 DM M 37 ## 9 9 7 16 1977 1 DM F 34 ## 10 10 7 16 1977 6 PF F 20 ## # ... with 34,776 more rows, and 5 more variables: weight &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # genus &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, taxa &lt;chr&gt;, plot_type &lt;chr&gt; Or we could use arrange() to find the record with the shortest hindfoot. Note: arrange() defaults to ascending order. surveys %&gt;% arrange(hindfoot_length) ## # A tibble: 34,786 x 13 ## record_id month day year plot_id species_id sex hindfoot_length ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 31400 9 30 2000 19 PB M 2 ## 2 10067 3 16 1985 19 RM M 6 ## 3 19567 1 8 1992 19 BA M 6 ## 4 19015 9 9 1991 19 BA F 7 ## 5 21036 8 19 1993 21 PF F 7 ## 6 31457 9 31 2000 6 RM M 8 ## 7 19191 10 11 1991 13 PF F 8 ## 8 5801 4 29 1982 7 RM &lt;NA&gt; 8 ## 9 33647 3 14 2002 3 PF M 9 ## 10 20562 12 22 1992 5 RM F 9 ## # ... with 34,776 more rows, and 5 more variables: weight &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # genus &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, taxa &lt;chr&gt;, plot_type &lt;chr&gt; To find the Cactus Mouse, (species_id == \"PE\") with the longest hindfoot we combine filter() with arrangee() using the pipe: Hint Use the desc() function to arrange from biggest to smallest. surveys %&gt;% filter(species_id == &quot;PE&quot;) %&gt;% arrange(desc(hindfoot_length)) ## # A tibble: 1,299 x 13 ## record_id month day year plot_id species_id sex hindfoot_length ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1202 9 3 1978 7 PE F 30 ## 2 517 1 8 1978 2 PE M 26 ## 3 32443 8 25 2001 23 PE F 24 ## 4 5080 12 30 1981 15 PE F 23 ## 5 5090 12 30 1981 15 PE F 23 ## 6 33700 3 14 2002 9 PE F 23 ## 7 604 2 18 1978 2 PE M 22 ## 8 12459 3 2 1987 2 PE F 22 ## 9 13992 1 24 1988 2 PE M 22 ## 10 14516 5 15 1988 2 PE F 22 ## # ... with 1,289 more rows, and 5 more variables: weight &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # genus &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, taxa &lt;chr&gt;, plot_type &lt;chr&gt; 2.3.3 Select columns with select() Often your data contains variables you don’t need for the analysis you are performing, or you want to subset them to share with others. To select only the ones you need, or explore subsets of the variables, the select() verb enables you to keep only the columns of interest. Figure 2.6 shows the use of select() to choose only the year and plot_type columns, with or without the pipe. Selecting the variables contained in the columns can be done in various ways. For example, by the column number, the variable name or by range. Check the help function ?select for more options. Figure 2.6: dplyr::select() # Select the year and plot type columns surveys %&gt;% select(year,plot_type) ## # A tibble: 34,786 x 2 ## year plot_type ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1977 Control ## 2 1977 Control ## 3 1977 Control ## 4 1977 Control ## 5 1977 Control ## 6 1977 Control ## 7 1977 Control ## 8 1978 Control ## 9 1978 Control ## 10 1978 Control ## # ... with 34,776 more rows We can also use negative selection by adding a minus sign - to variables we wish to discard. Here we discard sex,hindfoot_length and weight from the surveys_filtered object and keep everything else: # Select everything except sex, hindfoot and weight surveys_filtered %&gt;% select(-sex,-hindfoot_length,-weight) ## # A tibble: 20,729 x 10 ## record_id month day year plot_id species_id genus species taxa ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 7 16 1977 2 NL Neot~ albigu~ Rode~ ## 2 72 8 19 1977 2 NL Neot~ albigu~ Rode~ ## 3 224 9 13 1977 2 NL Neot~ albigu~ Rode~ ## 4 266 10 16 1977 2 NL Neot~ albigu~ Rode~ ## 5 349 11 12 1977 2 NL Neot~ albigu~ Rode~ ## 6 363 11 12 1977 2 NL Neot~ albigu~ Rode~ ## 7 435 12 10 1977 2 NL Neot~ albigu~ Rode~ ## 8 506 1 8 1978 2 NL Neot~ albigu~ Rode~ ## 9 588 2 18 1978 2 NL Neot~ albigu~ Rode~ ## 10 661 3 11 1978 2 NL Neot~ albigu~ Rode~ ## # ... with 20,719 more rows, and 1 more variable: plot_type &lt;chr&gt; 2.3.4 Create new variables with mutate() Another common task is to create a new variable or variables, often from existing data within the data frame. For this we use the mutate() verb. It follows the same syntax as for filter(), arrange() and select() in that the first argument is the dataset, and the subsequent arguments are the new variables we wish to create. Figure 2.7 shows how to create a new variable weight_kg by dividing the existing weight variable in grams by 1000. Figure 2.7: dplyr::mutate() A more complicated mutation, and key to to our analysis exploring the question as to whether Kangaroo rats effect the size of the granivore population would be to create a variable that indicates which type of rodent an observation is recording. To do this we can make use of another dplyr function called case_when(). This allows us to pass different values to our new rodent_type variable if they match either species_id values corresponding with Kangaroo rats or Granivores. To remind us, the rodents species surveyed are: Kangaroo Rats species_id Scientific name Common name DM Dipodomys merriami Merriam’s kangaroo rat DO Dipodomys ordii Ord’s kangaroo rat DS Dipodomys spectabilis Banner-tailed kangaroo rat Granivores species_id Scientific name Common name PP Chaetodipus penicillatus Desert pocket mouse PF Perognathus flavus Silky pocket mouse PE Peromyscus eremicus Cactus mouse PM Peromyscus maniculatus Deer Mouse RM Reithrodontomys megalotis Western harvest mouse The first argument to case_when() is the variable and value we want to match, just like filter(), for example species_id == \"DM\", and then we use the tilde operator ~ followed by the value we want give our new variable if a we match this condition. Here we want our new variable rodent_type to be “Kangaroo Rat”. We do this for every case we want to match. There are other species than rodents in this data, and we have choice to either provide values for each one, ignore them which will lead to the value NA for those rows or we can supply a single value to the rest by giving the argument TRUE followed by the value. This means if there are other values in species_id - if this is true - then give them all the same value. Here we supply the value “Other” for the remaining species: TRUE ~ \"Other\". Below is how this looks in practice and is assigned to a new surveys_mutated object. # Mutate surveys_filtered surveys_mutated &lt;- surveys_filtered %&gt;% # Create rodent type variable for K-rats and Granivores.Everything else, Other. mutate(rodent_type = case_when( species_id == &quot;DM&quot; ~ &quot;Kangaroo Rat&quot;, species_id == &quot;DO&quot; ~ &quot;Kangaroo Rat&quot;, species_id == &quot;DS&quot; ~ &quot;Kangaroo Rat&quot;, species_id == &quot;PP&quot; ~ &quot;Granivore&quot;, species_id == &quot;PF&quot; ~ &quot;Granivore&quot;, species_id == &quot;PE&quot; ~ &quot;Granivore&quot;, species_id == &quot;PM&quot; ~ &quot;Granivore&quot;, species_id == &quot;RM&quot; ~ &quot;Granivore&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;Other&quot;)) # Check output using distinct() surveys_mutated %&gt;% select(species_id,rodent_type) %&gt;% distinct(species_id, .keep_all = T) ## # A tibble: 42 x 2 ## species_id rodent_type ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 NL Other ## 2 DM Kangaroo Rat ## 3 PF Granivore ## 4 PE Granivore ## 5 DS Kangaroo Rat ## 6 PP Granivore ## 7 SH Other ## 8 OT Other ## 9 DO Kangaroo Rat ## 10 OX Other ## # ... with 32 more rows 2.3.5 Grouped summaries with group_by() and summarise() Finally we’ll look at the verb summarise() and it’s companion group_by(). summarise() collapses a data frame into a single row. For example as shown in Figure 2.8, we could use it to find the average weight of all the animals surveyed in the original data frame using mean(). (Here the na.rm = TRUE argument is given to remove missing values from the data, otherwise R would return NA when trying to average.) Figure 2.8: dplyr::summarise() surveys %&gt;% summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) ## # A tibble: 1 x 1 ## mean_weight ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 42.7 However summarise() is most useful when paired with group_by() which defines the variables upon which we operate upon. Figure 2.9 shows how by grouping the observations according to the sex and species_id variables, we can then calculate the mean_weight for each of these groups. Figure 2.9: dplyr::group_by() Using group_by() with summarise() now returns a table with 92 rows instead of single row. surveys %&gt;% group_by(sex, species_id) %&gt;% summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) ## # A tibble: 92 x 3 ## # Groups: sex [3] ## sex species_id mean_weight ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 F BA 9.16 ## 2 F DM 41.6 ## 3 F DO 48.5 ## 4 F DS 118. ## 5 F NL 154. ## 6 F OL 31.1 ## 7 F OT 24.8 ## 8 F OX 21 ## 9 F PB 30.2 ## 10 F PE 22.8 ## # ... with 82 more rows 2.4 Using dpylr to explore the effect of Kangaroo Rat exclusion on Granivore populations Let’s use what we’ve learnt so far to explore the effect of Kangaroo Rats on Granivore populations for the entire time covered in the surveys dataset. A line plot with time on the x-axis and number of rodents on the y-axis would be one way to visual this, comparing the observations between the control plots and the Kangaroo rat exclusion plots. One way to do this is to: filter() the observations for the control and exclusion plots. Create a new rodent_type variable for Kangaroo Rats and Granivores. Create a new variable for time from the existing day,month and year variables. Group the data according to the rodent_type, plot_type our time variable, and use summarise() to calculate the number of observations for each group. 2.4.1 Re-cap of filter() and mutate() Let’s re-cap steps one and two: # Keep only the rows corresponding with the Control and Long-term Krat Exclosure surveys_filtered &lt;- surveys %&gt;% filter(plot_type == &quot;Control&quot; | plot_type == &quot;Long-term Krat Exclosure&quot;) # Mutate surveys_filtered surveys_mutated &lt;- surveys_filtered %&gt;% # Create rodent type variable for K-rats and Granivores.Everything else, Other. mutate(rodent_type = case_when( species_id == &quot;DM&quot; ~ &quot;Kangaroo Rat&quot;, species_id == &quot;DO&quot; ~ &quot;Kangaroo Rat&quot;, species_id == &quot;DS&quot; ~ &quot;Kangaroo Rat&quot;, species_id == &quot;PP&quot; ~ &quot;Granivore&quot;, species_id == &quot;PF&quot; ~ &quot;Granivore&quot;, species_id == &quot;PE&quot; ~ &quot;Granivore&quot;, species_id == &quot;PM&quot; ~ &quot;Granivore&quot;, species_id == &quot;RM&quot; ~ &quot;Granivore&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;Other&quot;)) 2.4.2 Use lubridate to create new time variables Step three introduces the tidyverse lubridate package. As the name suggests, this is a package for wrangling dates and times. It would be clearer to plot the data on three month (quarterly) basis rather than plotting every date in the dataset, so we need to create a variable that contains the quarter in which the observation was made, for each observation. From lubridate we will use the function make_date() in combination with mutate() first to create a single column date variable from the day,month and year variables. We then use this date variable to create another new variable containing a value for the quarter of the year in which the observation was made quarter using the quarter() function. We’ll assign this output to a new data frame called surveys_subset. library(lubridate) surveys_subset &lt;- surveys_mutated %&gt;% mutate(date = make_date(day = day, month = month, year = year), quarter = quarter(date,with_year = TRUE)) 2.4.3 Group and summarise the data into quarterly observations Step four is to group and summarise our quarterly observations. We group by rodent_type, plot_type and quarter variables. In other words we’ve grouped the data according to Kangaroo Rat or Granivore, Control plot or Exclusion plot, and the quarter of the year in which the observation occurred. Then we can calculate the number of captures for each of these groups by using summarise() to create a mean_captures variable which is equal to the number of rows for that group using the n() function divided by 4 to calculate the average over each quarter. Note: n() is a dplyr function that returns the number of observations in the current group. by_quarter &lt;- surveys_subset %&gt;% group_by(rodent_type,plot_type,quarter) %&gt;% summarise(mean_captures = n()/4) by_quarter ## # A tibble: 567 x 4 ## # Groups: rodent_type, plot_type [6] ## rodent_type plot_type quarter mean_captures ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Granivore Control 1977. 3.75 ## 2 Granivore Control 1977. 2 ## 3 Granivore Control 1978. 2.75 ## 4 Granivore Control 1978. 2.25 ## 5 Granivore Control 1978. 3.25 ## 6 Granivore Control 1978. 1 ## 7 Granivore Control 1979. 1.25 ## 8 Granivore Control 1979. 1.5 ## 9 Granivore Control 1979. 1.25 ## 10 Granivore Control 1980. 5.5 ## # ... with 557 more rows These steps have taken us from a table of 34,786 observations to a table of 567 observations. 2.4.4 Create a plot with ggplot Now we can create a line and point plot, using the by_quarter data as our first ggplot() argument. For the aesthetics we are plotting the time on the x-axis using the quarter variable, and the quarterly mean_captures on the y-axis, and we colour the data by rodent_type. Then we create line and point geometric mappings, and split the plot into two facets using facet_wrap according to plot_type. ggplot(by_quarter, aes(x=quarter,y=mean_captures,colour=rodent_type)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~ plot_type) ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_path). ## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing missing values (geom_point). But it would be more useful to only plot the Kangaroo Rats and Granivores data, so let’s filter out the other species. And move the legend to the bottom of the plot and add a title. by_quarter %&gt;% filter(rodent_type != &quot;Other&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=quarter,y=mean_captures,colour=rodent_type)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~ plot_type) + theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;How does excluding Kangaroo Rats effect Granivore populations?&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Mean quarterly observations&quot;) ## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_path). ## Warning: Removed 3 rows containing missing values (geom_point). Challenge Can you do a similar analysis, but plotting the data only from 1980 to 2000 and by semester? "],
